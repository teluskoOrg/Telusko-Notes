## Lecture 05: Embedding and Vectors

### What Are Embeddings
- Embeddings represent text as numerical vectors.
- They help computers understand meaning rather than exact words.
- Used when searching without knowing exact keywords.
- Essential for similarity search in LLM workflows.

### What Are Vectors
- Vectors are lists of numbers used to represent words.
- Words with similar meanings have vectors close to each other.
- Example values: RGB colours like dark red (139,0,0).
- Word-to-vector conversion allows machines to compare meaning.

### Need for Similarity Search
- Example: searching for an employee when the exact key is unknown.
- Exact match search fails without precise keywords.
- Similarity search retrieves closest matches using embeddings.
- LLMs rely on this mechanism to understand and retrieve context.

### How LLMs Search
- Example query: “suggest a phone under $500.”
- Input is broken into tokens before processing.
- Each token is converted into vectors for understanding.
- LLMs generate output by comparing vector similarities.

### Understanding Transformers
- Transformers replaced RNN and CNN limitations.
- RNNs were used for NLP and CNNs for image recognition.
- Attention mechanism assigns weight to each word.
- Transformer encoder-decoder predicts the next word based on probability.

### Attention Mechanism
- Each word is given importance through weights.
- Example: “I was going to have my ______.”
- Prediction is based on the probability of the next token.
- Weights help the model focus on relevant words.

### Embedding Vector Example (OpenAI API)
- Embedding for “dog” can be requested via API.
- The POST request format is shown below.
- Model used: textembedding-3-large.
- Dimensions can be reduced for simplicity (e.g., 2).
- By sending the POST request to link you can get embedding for the words.

### Steps for sending request to API
- Use POST method to call the embeddings endpoint.
- Add header → "Content-Type": "application/json".
- Add header → "Authorization": "Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY]".
- Send the JSON body with model and input text.
```json
{
  "model": "text-embedding-3-large",
  "input": "dog",
  "dimensions": 2
}
```
