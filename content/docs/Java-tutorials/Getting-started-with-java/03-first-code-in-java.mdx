## Checking Installation in VS Code Terminal

To confirm that Java and VS Code are correctly set up, open the **VS Code integrated terminal** and run:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

These commands should show the installed Java version and the compiler version.


<Callout type="info">
Both commands must work.  
If *javac* fails, your JDK is not properly installed or JAVA_HOME is not set.
</Callout>


## Creating First Java File

Start by creating a file named:

**Hello.java**

* Every Java source file must end with `.java`.
* The filename must match the **public class name** (if present).

<Callout type="info">
In Java, the filename and public class name must match.  
This helps the compiler organize code into structured units.
</Callout>

## JShell (Interactive Mode)

JShell is Java's **interactive REPL**, introduced in Java 9.
It allows you to execute Java expressions instantly—no need to create files or compile.

### Open JShell

```bash
jshell
```

### Try basic expressions

```bash
2 + 3            // Output: 5
9 - 6            // Output: 3
print(6)         // Error
System.out.print(6)     
System.out.println("Hello World")
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why print(6) gives an error">
Java does not have a global `print()` function.  
All printing must be done using the `System.out` object.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>


## Compiling and Running Code

Below is a basic Java line similar to what you'd try inside JShell:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

However, this is **not valid** inside a `.java` file unless placed inside a proper class.

<Callout type="warning">
If you compile `Hello.java` with only one line of code,  
you will get an error because Java requires a class structure.
</Callout>

### Correct way to compile

```bash
javac Hello.java
```

If the file has incomplete code (e.g., missing class), you will receive compilation errors.


## Minimal Working Java Program

Here is the complete code that must be inside **Hello.java**:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Now compile and run:

```bash
javac Hello.java
java Hello
```
