title: How Java Works

## Basic Flow

Java runs through a layered architecture. Here’s the essential idea:

<Callout type="info">
The operating system communicates with hardware.  
The JVM runs on top of the OS, allowing Java to work on any machine.
</Callout>

Key points:

* To run any Java program (like *Hello World*), you need the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
* **OS** interacts directly with hardware.
* **JVM** runs above the OS → this is what makes Java **platform independent**.


## Platform Independence

**WORA – Write Once, Run Anywhere**

Java achieves platform independence because:

* You write code once
* Compile it into **bytecode**
* Any system with a **JVM** can run that bytecode

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why JVM Makes Java Platform Independent">
The JVM converts the same bytecode into machine-specific instructions.  
This means one compiled file can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc., without changes.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>


## Java Code Execution Flow

1. Write Java code → `.java` file
2. Compile using **javac** → produces **bytecode (`.class` file)**
3. **JVM executes** the bytecode → converts it into machine code for the OS/hardware

### Example Code

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

### Commands to Run

```bash
javac Hello.java    # Compiles and generates Hello.class
java Hello          # Executes -> Hello World
```


## Main Method Signature

The **required entry point** of every Java program is:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

* JVM looks specifically for this method to start the program.
* Any change in its structure will prevent execution.

<Callout type="warning">
If the main method signature is incorrect, the JVM cannot start your program.
</Callout>


## Diagram 1 – Code to Execution

```
Java Code (.java)  --javac-->  Bytecode (.class)  --JVM-->  Machine Code
```

## JDK, JRE, JVM

Below is a breakdown of the three essential components:

<Cards>
  <Card title="JDK (Java Development Kit)">
    Contains tools for development: compiler (javac), debugger, and includes the JRE.
  </Card>

  <Card title="JRE (Java Runtime Environment)">
    Provides libraries + JVM.  
    Needed to **run** Java programs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="JVM (Java Virtual Machine)">
    Executes the bytecode and converts it to machine code.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Diagram 2 – Inside the JDK

```
JDK
 ├── JRE
 │    ├── Libraries
 │    └── JVM
 └── Tools (javac, debugger, etc.)
```

## Key Points Summary

* `.java` → source code
* `.class` → bytecode
* **JVM executes** the bytecode
* Java is **OOP**, so code must be inside a **class**
