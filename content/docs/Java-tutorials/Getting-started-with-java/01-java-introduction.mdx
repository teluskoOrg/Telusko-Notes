## Why Java Became Popular

Java is widely used because it provides portability, clarity, and a powerful ecosystem suitable for applications ranging from small tools to enterprise-grade systems.

### Feature-Rich and Versatile

Java is used for:

* Web applications
* Android mobile apps
* Desktop software
* Enterprise systems
* Games
* Distributed systems


### Readable and Maintainable

* Java syntax is structured and easy to understand.
* Suitable for long-term, large-scale development.

### WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)

Java programs run on any system with a **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.

### Rich API Support

Java provides extensive libraries, especially the **Collections API**, which simplifies handling lists, sets, maps, and more.

#### Example: Using ArrayList

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
        names.add("Alice");
        names.add("Bob");
        names.add("Charlie");

        System.out.println(names);
    }
}
```

### Strong Exception Handling

Java provides robust mechanisms for catching and handling errors.

#### Example

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("You cannot divide by zero!");
}
```
