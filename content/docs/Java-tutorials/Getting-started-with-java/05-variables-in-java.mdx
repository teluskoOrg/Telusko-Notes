title: Variables in Java

<Video id="9RCuKrze_-k" />


## Why Do We Build Software?

Software exists to solve **real-world problems**, and every problem involves **data**.
This data must be stored, processed, and displayed — often temporarily — which is where **variables** come in.

<Callout type="info">
Variables allow programs to store data in memory while the program is running.
</Callout>

## What is a Variable?

A variable is like a **box** that holds data in memory.
Each variable has:

* A **name** (identifier)
* A **data type**
* A **value**

**Example:**

```java
int age = 25;    // 'age' is a variable of type int
```

## Naming Conventions

Follow these rules to name variables correctly:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Start Rules">
    Must begin with a **letter**, `_`, or `$`.  
    Cannot start with a number.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Meaningful Names">
    Variable names should reflect their purpose, such as  
    `studentName`, `accountBalance`, `totalMarks`.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Camel Case">
    Use **camelCase** for multi-word names:  
    `firstName`, `maxSpeed`.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Avoid Symbols">
    Do not use symbols like `@`, `%`, `-` in variable names.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Strongly Typed Language

Java requires every variable to have a **declared type**.

Examples of data types:

* `int` → whole numbers
* `double` → decimal numbers
* `String` → text
* `boolean` → true/false
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why Java Enforces Data Types?">
Because Java is **strongly typed**, it catches type errors during compilation, making programs more reliable.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Example Code 1 – Direct Computation

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(3 + 5);  
        System.out.println(8 + 7);  
    }
}
```

### Print vs Println

* `print` → prints on the **same line**
* `println` → prints and moves to the **next line**

## Example Code 2 – Using Variables

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 3;  
        System.out.println(num);   // Prints 3
    }
}
```

## Example Code 3 – Storing Results

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 3;
        int num2 = 5;
        int result = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println(result);   // Output: 8
    }
}
```

## Key Point Summary

* Variables are **containers** with a **name, type, and value**.
* Java enforces **type safety**.
* Calculations become easier and cleaner using variables.
