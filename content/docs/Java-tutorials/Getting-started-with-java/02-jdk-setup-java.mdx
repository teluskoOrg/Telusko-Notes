<Video id="WRISYpKhIrc" />

## IDE vs Editor

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Examples: **IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code**

Features include:

* Debugging support
* Autocomplete and code suggestions
* Project and build management
* Plugin ecosystem
* Integrated tools for compiling and running programs

### Editor (Lightweight Text Editors)

Examples: **Notepad, VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text**

Characteristics:

* Mainly text editing
* No built-in Java compiler or debugger
* Requires external Java setup
* Useful for quick editing but not full-scale development

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

* JDK contains the **Java compiler (`javac`)**, essential for compiling Java programs.
* Several distributions exist: **OpenJDK**, **Oracle JDK**, etc.
* Recommended to install the **latest version** for updated features.
* Java is **backward compatible**, meaning older programs generally run on newer JDK versions.

## LTS (Long-Term Support)

* LTS versions are maintained and supported for many years.
* Industry-preferred LTS versions: **Java 17** and **Java 21**.

## Installation & Setup

### Steps to Install JDK

1. Download JDK (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK).
2. Install and note the directory path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`).
3. Configure **Environment Variables**:

   * Add the JDK **bin path** (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin`).

### Environment Variables

* **User Variable** → affects only the current user.
* **System Variable** → applies system-wide for all users.

### Check Installed Version

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

## Steps to Install & Set Up VS Code

1. Download and install **VS Code**.

2. Install **Java Extensions Pack** from the Extensions Marketplace.

   Recommended extensions:

   * Extension Pack for Java
   * Debugger for Java
   * Java Test Runner
   * Maven for Java

3. Create or open a Java file → VS Code will automatically detect the JDK.


## Example Program to Verify Setup

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java Setup Successful!");
    }
}
```
