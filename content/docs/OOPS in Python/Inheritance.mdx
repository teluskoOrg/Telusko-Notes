## Why Python?

Python is one of the **fastest-growing programming languages** in the world. Its popularity is driven by:

- A large number of libraries and frameworks
- Wide adoption by companies across industries
- Its versatility across multiple domains such as:
  - Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
  - Web Development
  - GUI Applications
  - Software Development

Because of this, Python is often called a **general-purpose language**.

## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language**.

### Key Characteristics

- **Interpreted:** Code is executed line by line — no need for compilation
- **Object-Oriented:** Supports classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation
- **Supports Multiple Paradigms:**
  - Procedural Programming
  - Object-Oriented Programming
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Its syntax is simple and close to natural language, making it one of the easiest languages to learn.

## History of Python
