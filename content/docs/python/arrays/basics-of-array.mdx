An **array** in Python is a data structure used to store **multiple values of the same data type** in a single, contiguous block of memory. Arrays are particularly useful when working with **numeric data**, where uniform data types and memory efficiency are important.

Unlike lists, arrays are designed for **numeric computation**, and thus they are **more memory-efficient** when dealing with large datasets of numbers.

<Step>
## Need of Arrays

Arrays address several practical programming needs:

* Efficiently store and manipulate **large collections of numeric data**
* Perform operations on data of the **same type** without repeated type checks
* Use **less memory** compared to lists when dealing with homogeneous data
* Interface easily with **low-level languages (like C)** and system-level APIs

> For **simple array operations**, Python provides the built-in `array` module.
> For **advanced numerical computations**, libraries like **NumPy** are recommended.

<Step>
## Importing the Array Module

Before creating arrays, you must import the `array` module.

```python
import array

# OR (alias)
import array as arr

# OR (import all functions)
from array import *
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Creating an Array

Arrays are created using the `array()` constructor.
You must specify:

1. **Type code** (defines the data type)
2. **Initial values** (as a list or iterable)

### Syntax

```python
array(typecode, [values])
```

### Example

```python
from array import *

vals = array('i', [5, 9, 8, 4, 2])
print(vals)
```

**Explanation:**

* `'i'` → Type code for signed integers
* `[5, 9, 8, 4, 2]` → Initial values

All elements are stored **sequentially in memory**, making access and processing faster.

</Step>

<Step>
## Type Codes in Python Arrays

Python arrays use **type codes** to enforce single-type storage.

| Type Code | C Type        | Python Type | Size (bytes) | Description            |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `'b'`     | signed char   | int         | 1            | Signed integer         |
| `'B'`     | unsigned char | int         | 1            | Unsigned integer       |
| `'i'`     | signed int    | int         | 2 or 4       | Default integer        |
| `'I'`     | unsigned int  | int         | 2 or 4       | Non-negative integer   |
| `'f'`     | float         | float       | 4            | Floating point         |
| `'d'`     | double        | float       | 8            | Double precision float |
| `'u'`     | Py_UNICODE    | char        | 2            | Unicode character      |

### Signed vs Unsigned

* **Signed integers** can store both positive and negative numbers.
* **Unsigned integers** can store only non-negative values.

```python
from array import *

# Signed integers (allows negative values)
vals = array('i', [5, 9, -8, 4, 2])

# Unsigned integers (error if negative value used)
vals_unsigned = array('I', [5, 9, 8, 4, 2])
print(vals)
```

</Step>

---

<Step>
## Indexing and Accessing Elements

Array elements can be accessed using **index numbers**, starting from **0**.

![Array](/images/python/array_index.png)

```python
vals = array('i', [5, 9, 8, 4, 2])

print(vals[0])   # 5
print(vals[3])   # 4
```

### Get Array Length

```python
print(len(vals))   # Output → 5
```

### Array of Characters

```python
vals = array('u', ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])
print(vals)
# Output → array('u', 'aeiou')
```

</Step>

---

<Step>
## Traversing Arrays (Fetching Values)

There are **multiple ways** to fetch and display values from an array.

### Using For Loop (unknown length)

```python
for i in range(len(vals)):
    print(vals[i])
```

### Using For Loop (with known length)

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(vals[i])
```

### Using Direct Iteration

```python
for e in vals:
    print(e)
```

### Using While Loop

```python
i = 0
while i < len(vals):
    print(vals[i])
    i += 1
```

</Step>

## Summary

* Arrays are memory-efficient and ideal for handling numeric data.
* They provide better performance for numerical operations compared to lists.
* Arrays store only one data type, enforced through type codes.
* The array module must be explicitly imported before use.
* For advanced numerical and scientific computations, NumPy is generally the preferred option.
