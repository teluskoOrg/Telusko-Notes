Python provides two primary looping constructs: **while loops** and **for loops**.

While a `while` loop is controlled by a condition, the **for loop** is designed specifically for iterating over *sequences* and *iterable objects* in a clean and efficient manner.


<Step>
## Understanding For Loops

A **for loop** in Python iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code **once for each item** in that sequence.

**Syntax:**

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # statements
```

During each iteration, the variable stores the current element from the sequence.

## Difference Between While and For Loops

| Aspect       | While Loop                                             | For Loop                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Control      | Uses a condition                                       | Uses an iterable (list, range, string, etc.) |
| Manual Steps | Must manually handle counter, increment, and condition | All handled automatically                    |
| Best For     | Unknown number of iterations                           | Known sequences or ranges                    |
| Risk         | Higher risk of infinite loops                          | No risk of infinite loops                    |

The **for loop condenses initialization, condition checking, and incrementing into a single line**, making it cleaner and less error-prone.

## Iterating Over Collections

Python's `for` loop works seamlessly with any iterable.

### Example: Looping Through a List

```python
data = [2, "Navin", 4.5, 8, "Telusko", "Muskan"]

for value in data:
    print(value)
```

**Output**

```
2  
Navin  
4.5  
8  
Telusko  
Muskan
```

### Example: Looping Through a String

```python
for ch in "PYTHON":
    print(ch)
```

**Output:**

```
P
Y
T
H
O
N
```

### Example: Iterating Through a List Literal
```python
for i in [2, 6, 'Muskan']:
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
2
6
Muskan
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Using range() with For Loop

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used with `for` loops.

### Example: Default range (0 to 9)

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

### Example: Range with Start, Stop, and Step

```python
for i in range(11, 21, 1):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
```


### Example: Reverse range

You can reverse the range using a **negative step value**:

```python
for i in range(20, 10, -1):
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
20
19
18
17
16
15
14
13
12
11
```

### Example: No Output Case

```python
for i in range(20, 11):
    print(i)
```

Since the default step is `+1`, and the start is greater than the stop value, **no output** will be produced.

</Step>

<Step>
## Using Conditions Inside For Loops

You can add conditions inside the `for` loop to control which items are processed.

### Example 1: Skip Numbers Divisible by 5
```python
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 5 == 0:
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
11
12
13
14
16
17
18
19
```

### Example 2: Print Only Numbers Not Divisible by 5
```python
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 5 != 0:
        print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
11
12
13
14
16
17
18
19
```

## When to Use a Foor Loop?

![For_loop](/images/python/for_loop.png)

**Examples:**

* Processing a fixed number of records
* Looping through dictionary keys and values
* Generating even numbers from 2 to 20
* Looping through large datasets safely without infinite loop risks

</Step>

## Summary

* A `for` loop iterates directly over sequences like lists, strings, tuples, sets, or ranges.
* It automatically handles indexing, increments, and stopping—simpler than a while loop.
* Works best when the number of iterations is known or when working with collections.
* The `range()` is commonly used to generate numeric sequences for iteration.
* Conditions inside loops allow selective processing of elements.
* It avoids infinite loops because iteration ends automatically when the sequence ends.
