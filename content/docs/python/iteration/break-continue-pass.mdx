Python provides three special control statements—**`break`**, **`continue`**, and **`pass`**, which are used to alter the normal flow of execution within loops or conditional statements.


<Step>
## Introduction

In Python, loops (`for` and `while`) generally execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is false.  
However, sometimes we need more control over the flow of execution, for example:

- To exit a loop early
- To skip an iteration
- Or to write placeholder code that will be implemented later.

Python provides three special statements for these situations:

1. `break`
2. `continue`
3. `pass`

</Step>

## `break` Statement

The `break` statement is used to **terminate the loop immediately**, regardless of how many iterations remain.

### Syntax:

```python
for variable in sequence:
    if condition:
        break
    # code block
```

### Example

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print("Hello", i)
```

**Output**

```
Hello 0
Hello 1
Hello 2
```

### Explanation

- When `i == 3`, the `continue` statement is executed.
- The loop **skips the `print()` statement** for `i = 3` and jumps to the next iteration.
- The loop then continues normally for `i = 4`.

### Use Case

- Stop processing when a required value is found.
- Exit when a resource becomes unavailable.
- Terminate loops on certain error conditions.

</Step>

## `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement **skips the current iteration** of the loop and moves to the **next iteration**, without executing the remaining statements inside the loop for that iteration.

### Syntax:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print("Hello", i)
```

![Continue_Statement](/images/python/continue_python.png)

### Example

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print("Hello", i)
```

**Output**

```
Hello 0
Hello 1
Hello 2
Hello 4
```

### Explanation

- When `i == 3`, the `continue` statement is executed.
- The loop **skips the `print()` statement** for `i = 3` and jumps to the next iteration.
- The loop then continues normally for `i = 4`.

### Use Case

- Skip unwanted values (e.g., negative numbers, divisible numbers).
- Filter data inside loops.
- Avoid executing certain code for specific iterations.

## `pass` Statement

The `pass` statement acts as a **null operation**, it does nothing when executed.  
It’s used as a **placeholder** for future code, allowing you to define empty functions, classes, or loops without causing syntax errors.

### Syntax:

```python
def func():
    pass
```

### Why we need `pass`

Python does not allow empty:

- functions
- classes
- loops
- conditional blocks

![Pass_Statement](/images/python/pass_python.png)

> A function body cannot be empty in Python, it will raise an `IndentationError`. The `pass` statement allows defining a **syntactically valid structure** even when the logic is not yet implemented.

### Example

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
4
5
```

### Explanation

- When i == 3, the pass statement is executed.
- `pass` does nothing, so the loop simply moves ahead without any action for that iteration.
- For all other values of `i`, the `print()` statement runs normally.

### Use Case

- Placeholder when designing program structure.
- Temporary empty blocks during development.
- Skip an iteration intentionally (without any action).

## Comparison

| Statement    | Purpose                  | Effect on Loop          | Typical Usage                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **break**    | Exit the entire loop     | Loop stops immediately  | Stop searching, stop processing early |
| **continue** | Skip current iteration   | Next iteration starts   | Skip specific values or conditions    |
| **pass**     | Do nothing (placeholder) | Loop continues normally | Empty blocks for future use           |

### Example: Using All Three Together

```python
for i in range(6):
    if i == 2:
        continue    # skip iteration for i = 2
    elif i == 4:
        break       # stop loop at i = 4
    else:
        print("Processing:", i)
else:
    pass            # placeholder for when loop ends normally
```

**Output**

```
Processing: 0
Processing: 1
Processing: 3
```

</Step>

## Summary

- **`break`** → Immediately terminates the entire loop, stopping all remaining iterations and transferring control to the first statement after the loop.
- **`continue`** → Skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps directly to the next cycle of the loop.
- **`pass`** → Acts as a do-nothing placeholder that allows you to define empty loops, functions, classes, or conditional blocks without causing syntax errors.
- These statements provide fine-grained control over loops and conditional structures.
