In this lecture, we will learn **different methods to swap two variables** in Python.  
Swapping means exchanging the values of two variables.

Example:  
If `a = 5` and `b = 6`, after swapping —  `a` should become `6`, and `b` should become `5`.

Swapping is commonly used in programming tasks like **sorting**, **data manipulation**, and **algorithm optimization**.

<Step>
## 1. The Problem with Direct Assignment
If you try to directly assign `a = b`, you **lose the original value of `a`**, because it gets overwritten.

```python
a = 5
b = 6
a = b
b = a       # direct assignment
print(a)    # 6
print(b)    # 6
```

Now both `a` and `b` have the same value (`6`), and the original value of `a` is lost.

## 2. Swapping Using a Temporary Variable
This is the **classic method** for swapping two numbers.

```python
a = 5
b = 6

temp = a   # store value of a in temp
a = b      # assign value of b to a
b = temp   # assign value of temp (original a) to b

print(a)   # 6
print(b)   # 5
```

**Output:**
```
6
5
```

✔ Easy to understand

✔ Works for all data types

✘ Uses extra memory (one extra variable)

</Step>

## 3. Swapping Without Using a Third Variable
We can swap values **using arithmetic operations** without a temporary variable.

```python
a = 5
b = 6

a = a + b   # 5 + 6 = 11
b = a - b   # 11 - 6 = 5
a = a - b   # 11 - 5 = 6

print(a)    # 6
print(b)    # 5
```

**Output:**
```
6
5
```

✔ No extra variable

✘ Works only with numeric types

✘ May cause overflow in some languages (not in Python)

</Step>

## 4. Swapping Using XOR Bitwise Operator

The **XOR (^)** operation can also be used to swap two numbers **without using a third variable**.

```python
a = 5        # 0101 (in binary)
b = 6        # 0110 (in binary)

a = a ^ b    # 0101 ^ 0110 = 0011  → a = 3
b = a ^ b    # 0011 ^ 0110 = 0101  → b = 5
a = a ^ b    # 0011 ^ 0101 = 0110  → a = 6

print(a)     # 6 (0110)
print(b)     # 5 (0101)
```

**Output:**
```
6
5
```

✔ No extra variable

✔ Fast for low-level programming

✘ Works only with integers

</Step>

<Step>
## 5. Swapping Using Python’s Tuple Unpacking

Python provides a **simple and elegant** way to swap values in one line.

```python
a = 5
b = 6

a, b = b, a

print(a)    # 6
print(b)    # 5
```

**Output:**
```
6
5
```

How it works:

- Python forms a tuple (b, a)
- Then unpacks it back into (a, b)
- This prevents overwriting and works for any data type.

✔ Most readable

✔ Most efficient in Python

✔ No extra memory

✔ Works for all types (numbers, strings, objects, lists, etc.)

## Summary

| Method | Description |  Example Code |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Direct Assignment | Overwrites data | `a = b` |
| Using Temp Variable | Safe and simple | `temp = a; a = b; b = temp` |
| Arithmetic Method | Works for numbers | `a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b` |
| XOR Method | Bitwise swap | `a = a ^ b; b = a ^ b; a = a ^ b` |
| Tuple Unpacking | Pythonic & efficient | `a, b = b, a` |
