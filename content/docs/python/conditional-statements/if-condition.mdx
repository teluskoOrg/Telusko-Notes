Conditional statements allow a program to **make decisions** based on conditions.
Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control which block of code executes depending on whether an expression evaluates to **True** or **False**.

<Step>
## Why Do We Need Conditions?

The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the brain of every computer. It consists of three major units:

| Unit    | Full Form             | Function                                         |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **CU**  | Control Unit          | Manages instruction flow and controls operations |
| **ALU** | Arithmetic Logic Unit | Performs mathematical and logical decisions      |
| **MU**  | Memory Unit           | Stores variables, instructions, and data         |

The **ALU** has two sub-units:

* **AU (Arithmetic Unit):** Handles addition, subtraction, etc.
* **LU (Logic Unit):** Evaluates conditions like

  * Is the number even?
  * Is A > B?
  * Is the condition True or False?

The **Logic Unit** enables decision-making, and that is exactly what Python’s `if` statement uses.

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement allows Python to execute a block of code **only when the condition is True**.

### Syntax

```python
if condition:
    statements
```

**Key Rules:**

* Python does not use `{ }` like C/C++.
* Code blocks are defined using indentation (4 spaces recommended).
* If the condition is False, the block is skipped.

### Example:

```python
if True:
    print("I'm right")
```

**Output:**

```
I'm right
```

### Example (False condition):

```python
if False:
    print("I'm right")
print("Bye")
```

**Output:**

```
Bye
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Understanding Indentation in Python

Indentation is **mandatory** in Python and determines which statements belong to a block.

### Example 1 (Both inside the block):

```python
if True:
    print("Even")
    print("Bye")
```

**Output:**

```
Even
Bye
```

### Example 2 (Only first line is inside the block):

```python
if True:
    print("Even")
print("Bye")
```

**Output:**

```
Even
Bye
```

### Example 3 (Condition False):

```python
if False:
    print("Even")
print("Bye")
```

**Output:**

```
Bye
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Making Decisions Using Conditions

Conditions evaluate to **True** or **False**, allowing programs to behave dynamically.

**Example: Check if a number is even or odd.**

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")

if num % 2 == 1:
    print("Odd")

print("Bye")
```

**How it works:**

* `%` is the modulus operator → gives remainder
* Even number → `num % 2 == 0`
* Odd number → `num % 2 == 1`

</Step>

## Usage of the `if` Statement 

The `if` statement is used whenever a program must **choose between different actions**.
Common uses include:

* **Validating user input**

  ```python
  if age >= 18:
      print("Eligible to vote")
  ```

* **Performing calculations based on conditions**

  ```python
  if marks >= 40:
      print("Pass")
  ```

* **Executing code only when a condition is met**

  ```python
  if is_logged_in:
      show_dashboard()
  ```

* **Checking for errors or special cases**

  ```python
  if filename == "":
      print("Filename cannot be empty")
  ```

* **Making decisions in games, apps, and automation scripts**

  ```python
  if health <= 0:
      print("Game Over")
  ```

In short, **any situation that requires decision-making uses `if` statements**.

</Step>

## Summary

* The `if` statement is used to execute code **only when a condition is True**.
* Python determines code blocks using **indentation**, not curly braces.
* The **Logic Unit (LU)** of the CPU performs logical checks that help programs make decisions.
* Conditions like `num % 2 == 0` return True/False, controlling program flow.
* Using `if`, Python can perform intelligent decisions such as checking even/odd, validating input, comparing values, etc.
