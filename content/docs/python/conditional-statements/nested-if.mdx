# Nested `if` in Python

In Python, nested `if` statements allow you to place one decision-making block **inside another**.
This is useful when you need to check **multiple related conditions** before deciding what action to take.

A nested `if` executes **only when the outer `if` condition is True**.
Inside it, you can write another `if`, `elif`, or `else` to perform **secondary checks**.

<Step>
## Why Do We Use Nested `if`?

Nested `if` statements are helpful when:

* You need to make a decision **only after** another condition is satisfied.
* Conditions are **dependent** on each other.
* The logic is **tiered**, such as:
  * If user is eligible
    * Then check the user's score
      * Then decide the grade

This structure keeps your logic clean, readable, and organized.

## Syntax of Nested `if`

```python
if condition1:
    # Outer block
    if condition2:
        # Inner block
    else:
        # Inner else block
else:
    # Outer else block
```

Each block is defined using **indentation** (4 spaces recommended).
Indentation visually represents the level of nesting and controls which block executes.

## Example: Checking Number and Salary

```python
num = 6
salary = 5

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")                 # Outer if
    if salary > 5:
        print("Great Job")        # Inner if
    else:
        print("Better luck next time")  # Inner else
else:
    print("Odd")                  # Outer else

print("Bye")
```


### Output Cases

**Case 1: num = 6, salary = 5**

```
Even
Better luck next time
Bye
```

Reason:

* `num % 2 == 0` → True
* `salary > 5` → False → inner else runs


**Case 2: num = 6, salary = 7**

```
Even
Great Job
Bye
```

Reason:

* Outer condition is True
* Inner condition is also True → prints "Great Job"


**Case 3: num = 5**

```
Odd
Bye
```

Reason:

* Outer condition is False → inner block is completely skipped
* Only the outer `else` executes

</Step>

## Key Points to Remember

* A nested `if` executes *only* when the outer `if` is True.
* Proper **indentation** is needed, Python determines scope based on spaces.
* Helps structure multi-level decision making.
* Inner conditions are checked **only when needed**, improving clarity and efficiency.

## Summary

Nested `if` statements allow Python programs to make **layered decisions**, where one condition depends on another. They help handle complex logic cleanly by placing one decision block inside another, ensuring that secondary checks run only when primary conditions are met.
