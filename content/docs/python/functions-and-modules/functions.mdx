Functions are one of the most important building blocks in Python. They allow you to **organize**, **reuse**, and **simplify** code, especially in large programs.

<Step>
## Need for Functions

* Functions **eliminate repetition**. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you define it once and reuse it.
* They help build **modular**, **clean**, and **manageable** programs.
* Functions can be imported and reused across different files.
* They group related logic into a **named block**, improving both readability and maintainability.

Example **without** a function:

```python
a = 5
b = 4
c = a + b
print(c)
```

If you need to add numbers again, you must repeat the same lines → **inefficient**.

</Step>

<Step>
## What is a Function?

A function is a **named block of reusable code** created using the `def` keyword.

Syntax:

```python
def function_name():
    # indented block → function body
```


### Defining a Function

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
```

- `def` → keyword to define a function
- `greet` → function name
- `()` → parentheses (may contain parameters)
- `:` → indicates start of function block
- Indented block → body of the function


**Importance of Indentation**

* Python uses **indentation instead of curly braces**.
* All lines belonging to the function **must be indented**, otherwise Python cannot identify the function’s scope.


### Defining and Calling a Function
To use the function, simply call it by name:
```python
greet()
```

**Example:**
```python
def add():
    a = 5
    b = 4
    c = a + b
    print(c)

add()      # Calling the function
add()      # Can be called multiple times
```

Output:

```
9
9
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Function Parameters and Arguments

Functions can accept dynamic values using parameters, allowing the same function to work flexibly with different inputs each time it’s called.

### Example:

```python
def add(x, y):
    a = x
    b = y
    c = a + b
    print(c)

add(2, 3)      # 5
```

❌ **Incorrect call:**
When the function was defined without parameters.

```python
def add():

    a = x
    b = y
    c = a + b
    print(c)

add(2, 3)
```

Output:
```
TypeError: add() takes 0 positional arguments but 2 were given
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Return Statement

* If a function does not explicitly return a value, it automatically returns None, indicating the absence of a result.

* Use `return` to send a specific output back to the caller, allowing the function's result to be reused or stored.

### Example without return:

```python
def add(x, y):
    c = x + y
    print(c)

result = add(2, 3)
print("Result is : ", result)
```

Output:

```
5
Result is : None
```

### Example with return:

```python
def add(x, y):
    c = x + y
    return c

result = add(2, 3)
print("Result is : ", result)
```

Output:

```
Result is : 5
```

You can now reuse the returned value anywhere in your program.

</Step>

<Step>
## Docstrings — Documenting Functions

* Docstrings are triple-quoted strings placed at the **beginning of a function**.
* They describe what the function does.
* IDEs display them when hovering over the function name.

### Example:

```python
def add(x, y):
    """Adds two numbers and returns the result."""
    return x + y
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Summary

* Functions prevent repetition and improve modularity.
* Defined using `def` and identified by indentation.
* Functions can accept **parameters** and receive **arguments**.
* Without a `return` statement, functions return **None**.
* `return` allows the result to be reused.
* Docstrings describe the function’s purpose and act as built-in documentation.
