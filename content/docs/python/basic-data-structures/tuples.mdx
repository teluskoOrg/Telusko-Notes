Tuples are an essential built-in data structure in Python, offering a lightweight, fast, and reliable way to store ordered collections of items. They are often used when data must remain **constant and protected from modification**.

<Step>
## What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is an **ordered, immutable collection** of elements.
Once created, its elements **cannot be modified, added, or removed** — ensuring data safety and preventing accidental changes.

```python
tup = (23, 45, 67, 43)
print(type(tup))       # <class 'tuple'>
```

Python also allows tuple creation without parentheses:

```python
tup = 23, 45, 67, 43
```

Both are valid and represent the same structure.

## Key Characteristics of Tuples

**1. Ordered**: Elements retain the sequence in which they were defined.

**2. Immutable**: You cannot change or reassign elements.

```python
tup[2] = 65
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

**3. Heterogeneous**: A tuple can store mixed data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and even lists.

```python
tupA = (2, 'navin', 7.9)
```

**4. Faster than Lists**: Tuples are lighter and faster because they require less memory and have fixed sizes.

**5. Supports Indexing**: Elements can be accessed using indices.

```python
tup[2]   # Output: 67
```

</Step>

## Tuple Methods

Tuples offer only two built-in methods because they are immutable:

**1. `count()`**: Returns how many times a value occurs.

```python
tup = (5, 2, 5, 7)
tup.count(5)   # Output: 2
```

**2. `index()`**: Returns the index of the first occurrence.

```python
tup.index(7)   # Output: 3
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Built-in Functions with Tuples

Although tuples cannot be modified, you can still apply several built-in functions:

```python
min(tup)      # Minimum value
max(tup)      # Maximum value
len(tup)      # Number of elements
sum(tup)      # Only if all elements are numbers
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Tuple Unpacking

Python allows you to assign tuple elements to multiple variables in one line:

```python
tupA = (2, 'Navin', 7.9)
num, name, num1 = tupA
```

**Important:** The number of variables must match the number of tuple elements:

```python
num, name, num1, num2 = tupA
# ValueError: not enough values to unpack
```

</Step>

## Mutability Inside Tuples

While tuples themselves are immutable, they can contain **mutable objects** (like lists).
These nested objects *can* be modified:

```python
tupB = (34, 'navin', [3, 4, 5, 6])

tupB[2][1] = 9
print(tupB)
# (34, 'navin', [3, 9, 5, 6])
```

The tuple structure stays fixed, but the inner list changes — showing immutability applies only to the **tuple container**, not its **contents**.

</Step>

<Step>
## Membership Check

Use the `in` keyword to verify if an element exists in a tuple:

```python
34 in tupB        # True
'Navin' in tupB   # False
```

</Step>

---

<Step>
## Single-Element Tuple

A tuple with **one element must include a trailing comma**:

```python
tup = (45)
type(tup)     # int

tup = (45,)
type(tup)     # tuple
```

Without the comma, Python reads it as a normal integer.

</Step>

## Summary

Tuples are ideal when you need an ordered, unchangeable, and high-performance data structure. They help ensure data integrity, prevent accidental modifications, and are especially useful when returning multiple values from functions or storing information that should remain constant throughout the program.
