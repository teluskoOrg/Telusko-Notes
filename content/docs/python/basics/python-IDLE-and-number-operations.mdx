When working with Python, you need an environment where your code can execute. Windows provides **Command Prompt** and **PowerShell**, each with different capabilities.

* **Command Prompt (cmd):** Supports only built-in Windows commands.
* **PowerShell:** More powerful; supports scripting, advanced commands, and works like Linux/macOS terminals.

Both can run Python through the command:

```
python
```

This starts **Python IDLE (REPL mode)** — an interactive shell where Python executes your commands immediately.

**Example:**

```python
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
```

## Airthmetic Operations
Python supports the standard arithmetic operators. Below each operator is explained and illustrated with examples and expected output.

### Addition `+`

```python
>>> 2 + 3
5
```

*Adds two numbers.*

### Subtraction `-`

```python
>>> 9 - 8
1
```

*Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.*

### Multiplication `*`

```python
>>> 4 * 6
24
```

*Multiplies operands.*

### True division `/` (returns `float`)

* The division operator `/` always returns a float even if both operands are integers.

```python
>>> 8 / 4
2.0
>>> 5 / 2
2.5
```

*This is useful because division can produce non-integer results; returning a float preserves precision.*

### Floor (integer) division `//`

* Use `//` if you want only the integer part (the quotient) and to discard any fractional remainder.

```python
>>> 10 // 3
3
>>> -7 // 3
-3  # floor division rounds toward negative infinity
```

> Note: with negative numbers `//` performs floor division — results may look unintuitive if you expect truncation toward zero.*

### Modulus `%` (remainder)

```python
>>> 10 % 3
1
```

*Returns remainder of division.*

### Exponentiation `**`

```python
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 4 ** 0.5
2.0  # square root
```

*Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.*

### Operator precedence and parentheses

Python obeys the usual mathematical rules (BODMAS). Use parentheses to change order.

```python
>>> 8 + 2 * 3
14
>>> (8 + 2) * 3
30
```

> **Common pitfall:** incomplete expressions cause syntax errors:

```python
>>> 8 + 9 -
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

## Using the Underscore `_` in Python IDLE

In Python, the underscore `_` is a special built-in name that automatically stores the **result of the last executed expression**.
This allows you to reuse the previous output without retyping it, making calculations faster and more convenient.

**Example1:**

```python
>>> 10 + 5
15

>>> _ * 2
30
```

Explanation:

* After evaluating `10 + 5`, Python stores the result (`15`) in `_`.
* When you enter `_ * 2`, Python uses the stored value (`15`) and performs:
  15 × 2 = 30

**Example1:**

```python
>>> 50 // 3
16

>>> 1 + _
17
```

Python automatically uses the last result (`16`) and adds `1`.

## **Variables in Python**

A **variable** is a name used to store a value in memory.
Python creates variables automatically when a value is assigned.

### Example:

```python
x = 2
print(x + 3)     # Output: 5

y = 3
print(x + y)     # Output: 5
```

### Variables are mutable

Values of variables can be changed easily:

```python
x = 9
print(x)        # 9
print(x + y)    # 12
```

### Assigning expressions to variables

When you assign a value, nothing is printed unless you use `print()`.

```python
num_one = 8**3
# No output
print(num_one)
# 512
```

</Step>

## Summary

- Python IDLE can be accessed by typing python in Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- Python supports standard arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.
- `/` returns a float, while `//` gives the integer (floor) result.
- Python follows BODMAS, and parentheses can override precedence.
- In IDLE, `_` stores the result of the previous expression for reuse.
- Variables store values for later use, and results appear only when using `print()` statement.
