Working with Python begins with installing the **Python interpreter**, which is responsible for executing your code. Python runs on all major operating systems—Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can be easily downloaded from the official website.

<Step>
## Need for Python Installation

To build software or applications using Python, two components are essential:

### 1. Python Interpreter

* The interpreter reads and executes Python code.
* Without it, your computer cannot understand or run `.py` files.

### 2. IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

An IDE provides a user-friendly workspace where you can:

* Write code
* Test and debug programs
* Run Python scripts efficiently

#### Popular IDEs for Python

* **Python IDLE** – comes pre-installed with Python
* **PyCharm** (JetBrains) – most widely used and feature-rich IDE for Python
* **VS Code** – lightweight and highly customizable
* **Anaconda (Spyder / Jupyter)** – preferred for data science

## Installing Python

### Step 1: Check if Python is Already Installed

Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** and run:
```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

If you see an error like this, then Python is not installed:
```bash
Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store...
```

### Step 2: Download Python

1. Visit the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the **latest stable Python version** (e.g., *Python 3.13.5*).
3. Choose the correct installer:
   
   * Windows 64-bit → Recommended for most systems (Intel i5/i7, AMD Ryzen)
   * ARM version → Only if your device specifically supports ARM

> Check the option "Add Python.exe to PATH" during installation. This ensures Python commands work in the terminal.


### Step 3: Verify Installation

Open **Command Prompt / Terminal** and run:

```
python --version
```

or

```
python3 --version
```

If installed correctly, it will display something like:

```
Python 3.13.5
```

<Step>
## Running Python Code

You can run Python programs in the following ways:


### 1) Python Interactive Shell (REPL)

Start Python directly in the terminal:

```
> python
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
```

This mode is great for testing small code snippets.



### 2) Running Python Files (.py)

For multi-line code:

1. Open an editor or IDE
2. Write your Python code
3. Save the file with the **.py extension**, e.g., `Demo.py`

Navigate to the folder in your terminal:

```
> cd path/to/folder
> ls    # show files
```

Run the script:

```
> python Demo.py
```

Output:

```
Hello
```

## Importance of the .py File Extension

The `.py` extension plays a vital role in Python programming. It identifies a file as a Python script and ensures that tools, interpreters, and IDEs handle the file correctly. Without this extension, the Python interpreter and development tools cannot treat the file as executable Python code.


### 1. Recognized as Python Source Code

Files ending with `.py` are automatically understood by the Python interpreter as Python scripts.
This allows commands like:

```
python script.py
```

to execute the file successfully.


### 2. Full IDE Support (Syntax Highlighting, Debugging, Intellisense)

IDEs such as PyCharm, VS Code, and IDLE depend on the `.py` extension to enable:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code suggestions
* Error detection
* Debugging tools

A file saved as `.txt` will not receive these features because the IDE does not treat it as Python code.


### 3. Modules and Imports Work Only With `.py` Files

Python’s import system recognizes only `.py` files as modules.
For example:

```python
import utils
```

will work only if the file is named:

```
utils.py
```

If it is `utils.txt`, Python cannot import it.


| File Name      | Recognized as Python Code? | Executable? |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✅ `script.py`  | Yes                        | Yes         |
| ❌ `script.txt` | No                         | No          |
