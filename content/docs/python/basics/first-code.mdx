Programming begins with writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. To work with data, we need to store it, process it, and retrieve it, which requires to write code using a programming language.

Python is a high-level, interpreted language designed to be easy to read and write. The interpreter translates Python code into bytecode and executes it, ultimately running machine-level instructions.

We use programming languages like Python because computers only understand binary (0s and 1s), programming languages provide a human-friendly way to write instructions that get translated into machine code.

<Step>
## How Python Code Runs?

To execute Python code, you need two things:

1. **A text editor or IDE** – where you write the code
2. **A compiler/interpreter** – that converts your code into **machine language** (binary) so the computer can execute it.
   The interpreter reads it, converts it to binary internally, and displays the output on the console.

## Running First Python Program (Online IDE)

Before installing Python on your computer, you can try writing and running Python code online.

### Using OnlineGDB (Online Python Compiler)

Website: **[https://www.onlinegdb.com/](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)**

**Steps:**

1. Open the website
2. Select **Python 3** as the programming language
3. A default template (comments + sample “Hello Python” code) appears
4. Click **Run**
5. The code will be:

   * Compiled into binary
   * Executed
   * Output will appear in the console window

### First Code

```python
print("Hello Python")
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Python
```
