title: Labels in java
---

## 1. Introduction

In Java, **labels** are identifiers placed before statements.  
They are most commonly used with **break** and **continue** inside **nested loops** to control loop flow more precisely.

A label allows you to:

- Break out of **multiple nested loops** at once  
- Continue an outer loop from inside an inner loop  
- Improve readability in certain complex loop scenarios  

Labels are **not** used for `goto` (Java does not support `goto`).  
They only work with loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) and blocks.



## 2. Syntax of Labels

A label is simply a name followed by a colon:

```java
labelName:
    statement;
````

Most commonly:

```java
outerLoop:
for (...) {

    innerLoop:
    for (...) {

    }

}
```

Labels **do not** change program logic by themselves;
they only serve as a target for `break` and `continue`.

## 3. Labeled Break

A labeled `break` lets you exit **more than one loop at the same time**.

### Example: Breaking Out of Nested Loops

```java
outer:
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        if (i == 2 && j == 2) {
            break outer; // exits BOTH loops
        }
        System.out.println(i + " " + j);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
```

Once `i == 2` and `j == 2`, the program jumps out of the outer loop completely.



## 4. Labeled Continue

A labeled `continue` skips the remaining loop body and continues the **next iteration of the labeled loop**.

### Example: Continue Outer Loop

```java
outer:
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        if (j == 2) {
            continue outer;  // skips to next iteration of outer loop
        }
        System.out.println("i=" + i + ", j=" + j);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
i=1, j=1
i=2, j=1
i=3, j=1
```

Explanation:

* When `j == 2`, instead of continuing inner loop, it jumps to next `i` (outer loop).



## 5. Labels with Blocks (Less Common)

Labels can also be used with **non-loop blocks**, though rarely needed.

```java
block1: {
    System.out.println("Inside block 1");
    break block1;
    // code below is skipped
}
```

This is legal but **not recommended** because it behaves like a restricted `goto`.



## 6. Real-World Use Cases

### ✔ Searching in a 2D Array

```java
search:
for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        if (matrix[i][j] == target) {
            found = true;
            break search;
        }
    }
}
```

### ✔ Skipping expensive computations

```java
outer:
for (Task task : tasks) {
    for (User user : users) {
        if (!user.isActive()) continue outer;
        task.process(user);
    }
}
```

## 7. Things Labels Cannot Do

* Labels CANNOT jump **forward or backward** arbitrarily like `goto`.
* Labels CANNOT be used inside expressions.
* Labels ONLY work with:

  * `break`
  * `continue`
* Labels DO NOT change execution order by themselves.



## 8. Best Practices

###  Use labels **only when necessary**

Unlabeled loops are clearer and easier to maintain.

###  Prefer refactoring complex nested loops

Break logic into methods instead of deep nesting.

###  Use meaningful label names

Bad:

```java
x:
for (...) {}
```

Good:

```java
searchLoop:
for (...) {}
```

###  Avoid overusing labels

They can make control flow harder to follow.



## 9. Summary

* Labels are identifiers used to control flow in nested loops.
* They work only with `break` and `continue`.
* `break label` exits multiple loops.
* `continue label` jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop.
* Useful in nested loop scenarios like matrix searches.
* Should be used sparingly to maintain readability.
