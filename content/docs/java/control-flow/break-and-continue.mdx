title: Break and Continue
---
## 1. Introduction

`break` and `continue` are **jump statements** in Java used to change the normal flow of loops and switch statements.

- **break** → immediately terminates the loop (or switch)
- **continue** → skips the current iteration and moves to the next one

They are powerful tools for controlling program flow, especially in complex loops, searching algorithms, and conditional iterations.



## 2. The `break` Statement

### Purpose:
- Stops the loop immediately  
- Control jumps to the first statement **after the loop**

### Syntax:

```java
break;
```

### Example 1: Stop Loop When Condition Met

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

Explanation: Loop stops when `i` becomes 5.



### Example 2: `break` in a `while` Loop

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    if (i == 7) break;
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```



### Example 3: `break` in `switch`

```java
switch (day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Invalid");
}
```

Without `break`, execution would **fall through** to the next case.

## 3. The `continue` Statement

### Purpose:

* Skips the remaining code in the loop body
* Moves to the **next iteration** immediately

### Syntax:

```java
continue;
```

### Example 1: Skip Even Numbers

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output:

```
1
3
5
```

Explanation: When `i` is even, continue skips printing.

### Example 2: `continue` in `while`

```java
int i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
    i++;
    if (i == 3) continue;
    System.out.println(i);
}
```



## 4. Difference Between Break and Continue

| Feature    | break                 | continue                |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Effect     | Exits the loop        | Skips current iteration |
| Flow jumps | Outside loop          | To next iteration       |
| Use cases  | Searching, early exit | Skipping unwanted cases |

## 5. Labeled Break and Continue (Advanced)

Useful for nested loops.
A **label** allows `break` or `continue` to target a specific loop.

### 5.1 Labeled Break

```java
outer:
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        if (j == 2) break outer;
        System.out.println(i + " " + j);
    }
}
```

Stops both loops when `j == 2`.



### 5.2 Labeled Continue

```java
outer:
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        if (j == 2) continue outer;
        System.out.println(i + " " + j);
    }
}
```

Skips inner loop and continues the **next iteration of outer** loop.



## 6. Real-World Use Cases

### ✔ Searching Algorithms

```java
for (int n : arr) {
    if (n == target) {
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

### ✔ Skipping Invalid Input

```java
for (String s : data) {
    if (s.isEmpty()) continue;
    process(s);
}
```

### ✔ Exiting Loops Based on Conditions

```java
while (true) {
    if (exitRequested()) break;
}
```


## 7. Common Mistakes

* Using `continue` when `break` is needed (or vice versa)
* Forgetting that `continue` in `while` may cause infinite loops if increment is skipped
* Overusing labeled break/continue (reduces readability)
* Confusing `break` in switch vs loop



## 8. Summary

* `break` ends the loop immediately.
* `continue` skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration.
* Both help control flow efficiently in complex conditions.
* Labeled versions allow control in nested loops.
* Use them carefully for clarity and maintainability.
