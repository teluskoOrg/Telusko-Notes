## Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements allow a program to **make decisions**.  
They enable Java to choose different paths of execution based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

Whenever you see an `if` statement, think of it as the program asking a **yes/no question**.  
If the answer is “yes” (true), some code will run.  
If the answer is “no” (false), another block of code may run instead.

### General Form

```java
if (condition) {
    // executes if condition is true
} else {
    // executes if condition is false
}
```

The condition must always evaluate to a **boolean value**.


## Flowchart Representation

```
        [Condition?]
           /   \
        True    False
        /          \
 [Execute Block1]  [Execute Block2]
```

This flowchart shows how the program checks the condition and decides which block of code to execute.


## Real-World Example – Car Speed

Imagine cruise control in a car:

* If speed is **above** the limit → decrease speed
* If speed is **below** the limit → increase speed
* If speed is **equal** to the limit → maintain the speed

This is exactly how `if-else` works in real programs: different actions for different conditions.


## Example 1 – Basic If

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 18;
        if (x > 10) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

* The program checks whether `x > 10`.
* Since 18 is greater than 10, the condition is **true**, and `"Hello"` is printed.
* If the condition were false, nothing inside the block would execute.

## Example 2 – If with Else

```java
int x = 8;
if (x > 10 && x <= 20) {   // Valid range: 11 to 20
    System.out.println("Hello");
} else {
    System.out.println("Bye");
}
```

### Understanding the Logic

* If `x` lies **between 11 and 20**, print `"Hello"`.
* Otherwise, print `"Bye"`.

**Note:**

* `if` can exist on its own.
* `else` **must always** be paired with an `if`.

## Example 3 – Comparing Two Numbers

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 7;

if (x > y) {
    System.out.println(x);
} else {
    System.out.println(y);
}
```

Output:

```
7
```

The larger number is printed based on the condition.

## Example 4 – Braces Matter

Incorrect version:

```java
if (x > y)
    System.out.println(x);
    System.out.println("Thank you"); // Always runs - NOT part of if
else
    System.out.println(y); // Error
```

This code fails because:

* Without braces `{}`, Java treats **only one line** as part of the `if`.
* `"Thank you"` always prints, even when `x > y` is false.
* The `else` gets misaligned and causes a compilation error.

### Correct version:

```java
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println(x);
    System.out.println("Thank you");
} else {
    System.out.println(y);
}
```

Braces ensure both statements belong to the `if` block.


## Key Notes

* Java **does not rely on indentation** (unlike Python).
  Whether the code is indented or not, the compiler only follows braces `{}`.
* Always use **braces** when you have more than one statement in a block.
* Using braces even for a single statement improves clarity and reduces bugs.
* `if-else` is the foundation of decision-making and will be used heavily in loops, validations, and algorithms.
