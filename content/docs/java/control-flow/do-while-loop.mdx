## Why Do-While Loop?

In many programs, we sometimes need a loop that **executes at least once**, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.  
This is exactly what the **do-while loop** is designed for.

Unlike a `while` loop (which checks the condition before running), the `do-while` loop runs the body first and **then** checks the condition.  
Because of this structure, the loop body always executes **at least once**, even if the condition is false initially.

## Syntax

```java
do {
    // statements
} while (condition);
```

### How it works:

1. Execute the block inside `do { ... }`
2. Check the condition in `while (condition)`
3. If condition is **true**, repeat the loop
4. If condition is **false**, stop the loop


## Example 1 – Condition False but Runs Once

```java
int i = 5;
do {
    System.out.println("Hi " + i);
} while (i <= 4);
```

### Output

```
Hi 5
```

### Explanation

* Even though the condition `i <= 4` is **false** for `i = 5`,
* The loop body **executes once** before the condition is checked.
* Since the condition becomes false afterward, the loop stops immediately.

This demonstrates the key feature of `do-while`: **first run, then check**.


## Example 2 – Works Like a While Loop When Condition is True

```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Hi " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 4);
```

### Output

```
Hi 1
Hi 2
Hi 3
Hi 4
```

### Explanation

* The condition `i <= 4` is true initially, so the loop keeps running.
* Each iteration prints the value of `i` and increments it.
* When `i` becomes 5, the condition turns false and the loop stops.

In this case, the `do-while` behaves the same as a regular `while` loop, but still carries the guarantee of at least one execution.


## Key Difference: while vs do-while

### Understanding the difference is important because it affects loop behavior.

| Feature              | while loop                            | do-while loop                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Condition checked    | **Before** execution                  | **After** execution               |
| Executes at least 1? | Not guaranteed                        | Guaranteed                        |
| When to use?         | When condition may be false initially | When execution should happen once |

### Simple Explanation

* **while**: "Check first, then run"
* **do-while**: "Run once, then check"


## Summary

* Use `do-while` when you want the loop body to run **at least once**.
* It is especially useful for tasks like:

  * Input validation
  * Menu-driven programs
  * Reading values until a stop condition
* A `while` loop may skip execution entirely, but a `do-while` loop will not.
