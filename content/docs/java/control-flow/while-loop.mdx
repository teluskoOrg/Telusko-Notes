## Why While Loop?

A **while loop** is used when we want to repeat a task **as long as a certain condition remains true**.  
It is especially useful when the number of repetitions is **not known in advance**.

The structure is simple:

```java
while (condition) {
    // statements
}
```

The loop continuously evaluates the condition:

* If **true**, the body executes.
* If **false**, the loop stops.

This makes the `while` loop perfect for real-world situations like waiting for user input, reading data until the end of a file, or running a task until a goal is met.


## Example 1 – Infinite Loop

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Hi");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

* The condition is `true`, which **never becomes false**.
* This results in an infinite loop.
* `"Hi"` gets printed endlessly until the program is forcibly stopped or system resources run out.

Infinite loops can be intentional (e.g., servers waiting for requests) or accidental due to missing updates.


## Example 2 – Loop with Counter

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 4) {
    System.out.println("Hi " + i);
    i++;
}
System.out.println("Bye " + i);
```

### Output

```
Hi 1
Hi 2
Hi 3
Hi 4
Bye 5
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   `int i = 1;` sets the starting point.

2. **Condition:**
   `i <= 4` ensures the loop runs while `i` is 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. **Update:**
   `i++` moves the counter toward termination.

4. After the loop, `i` becomes 5, so `"Bye 5"` prints outside the loop.

This example shows the typical structure of a controlled while loop.


## Example 3 – Nested While Loop

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 4) {
    System.out.println("Hi " + i);

    int j = 1;
    while (j <= 3) {
        System.out.println("Hello " + j);
        j++;
    }

    i++;
}
```

### Output

```
Hi 1
Hello 1
Hello 2
Hello 3
Hi 2
Hello 1
Hello 2
Hello 3
Hi 3
Hello 1
Hello 2
Hello 3
Hi 4
Hello 1
Hello 2
Hello 3
```

### Explanation

* The **outer loop** runs 4 times (`i = 1` to `4`).
* For each iteration of the outer loop:

  * The program prints `"Hi i"`.
  * Then the **inner loop** runs 3 times (`j = 1` to `3`), printing `"Hello j"`.

Nested loops are useful for:

* Printing patterns
* Working with 2D arrays
* Handling repeated tasks inside repeated tasks


## Key Notes

* **Initialization** happens before the loop begins.
* **Condition** is checked before every iteration (pre-test loop).
* **Update step** (e.g., `i++`) must be included to avoid infinite loops.
* A `while` loop may run **zero times** if the condition is false initially.
* Loops can be **nested** for multi-level repeated tasks.
* Incorrect or missing updates can easily lead to **infinite loops**.
