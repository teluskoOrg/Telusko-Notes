title: Which loop to use when

<Video id="uO5nSTJ9Iz4" />

Java provides three primary looping constructs—`while`, `do-while`, and `for`—and an additional enhanced loop (`for-each`) for collections.  
Understanding *when* to use each loop helps you write clearer and more efficient code.

Choosing the right loop depends on **whether you know the number of repetitions** and **how the loop condition behaves**.

## 1. For Loop

Use the `for` loop when you know *exactly how many times* the loop should run.

It combines **initialization**, **condition**, and **update** in one line, making it ideal for loops that count or iterate in a predictable manner.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### When to use a `for` loop?

* When the number of iterations is **fixed or easily calculated**
* When using a **counter/index**
* When iterating through a **range of numbers**
* When writing compact, structured loops

Common examples:

* Printing a list of numbers
* Running a loop a fixed number of times
* Nested loops for patterns or tables

## 2. While Loop

Use the `while` loop when the number of iterations is **not known beforehand**.
The loop continues as long as the condition remains true.

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

### When to use a `while` loop?

* When the loop depends on **changing conditions**
* When you may **not enter** the loop at all
* When input, file reading, or dynamic conditions control the loop

Practical examples:

* Waiting for user input
* Reading data from a file until the end
* Continuously checking a sensor value

## 3. Do-While Loop

A `do-while` loop is similar to a `while` loop, but with one important difference:
It **executes at least once**, even if the condition is false from the start.

```java
int i = 11;
do {
    System.out.println(i);   // executes once
    i++;
} while (i <= 10);
```

### When to use a `do-while` loop?

* When a task must run **at least once**
* When the loop condition is checked **after** execution
* When designing menu-driven or input-driven programs

Real-world use:

* ATM menu
* Game menus
* Asking user “Do you want to continue?”


## 4. Enhanced For Loop (for-each)

The enhanced for loop (also called **for-each**) is used to iterate through **arrays or collections** without needing an index.

```java
int[] nums = {10, 20, 30};
for (int n : nums) {
    System.out.println(n);
}
```

### When to use `for-each`?

* When you want to access every element directly
* When you don't need the index
* When working with arrays, lists, sets, maps (keys or values)

It improves readability and reduces the chance of index errors.


## Summary Table

| Loop Type    | When to Use                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **for**      | Number of iterations is known                    |
| **while**    | Unknown repetitions; condition controls the loop |
| **do-while** | Must run at least once                           |
| **for-each** | Traversing arrays or collections                 |


## Golden Rule

* Use **for** → when you know *how many times*
* Use **while** → when you know *until when*
* Use **do-while** → when it must run *at least once*
* Use **for-each** → when working with *collections/arrays*

These rules make it easy to choose the right loop for any situation.
