## Why Do We Need Loops?

In real programs, we frequently encounter situations where a particular task needs to be performed **multiple times**.  
If we try to repeat the same statement manually, the code becomes long, repetitive, and difficult to maintain.

Using `if-else` cannot help here, because an `if` condition is checked **only once**, not repeatedly.  
To repeat logic automatically, Java provides **loops**, which allow a block of code to run again and again as long as a condition is satisfied.

Loops help us:

- Reduce repetition in code  
- Improve readability  
- Make programs dynamic and flexible  
- Perform repeated tasks efficiently


## Example Without Loop

```java
System.out.println("Hi");
System.out.println("Hi");
System.out.println("Hi");
System.out.println("Hi");
```

This works, but:

* Hard to maintain
* More lines of code
* Changing count requires editing multiple statements
* Not practical for large repetitions (e.g., 1000 times)


## Example With Loop

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hi");
}
```

This version is:

* Short
* Structured
* Easy to update (just change loop limit)
* Efficient even for very large repetitions

If you want to print “Hi” 1000 times, simply change `i <= 4` to `i <= 1000`.


## Loops in Java

Java offers three main looping constructs.
Each loop is designed for a specific scenario, but all serve the same purpose—**repeat code automatically**.

### 1. **for loop**

Used when the number of repetitions is known in advance.

### 2. **while loop**

Used when you want to repeat something *while* a condition remains true.

### 3. **do-while loop**

Similar to while, but guarantees that the loop body runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false initially.

## Key Idea

Loops make code:

* **Clean** → remove unnecessary repetition
* **Efficient** → one loop replaces many lines
* **Dynamic** → behavior changes with variable values
* **Scalable** → repeat logic hundreds or thousands of times easily

In any real program—printing messages, processing arrays, reading data, performing calculations—loops are essential tools that make Java programs powerful and flexible.
