title: Switch Statement

<Video id="IrQKDdptiw8" />

## Why Switch?

In many programs, we need to compare a single value against several possible options.  
If we try to do this using a long chain of `if-else-if` statements, the code quickly becomes difficult to read, maintain, and debug.

The **switch statement** solves this problem by providing a clean, organized structure for handling multiple possible outcomes based on one variable.  
This makes the code easier to understand because:

- Each case clearly represents a specific value  
- All possible choices stay grouped together  
- We avoid repeating the variable inside every condition  
- It improves readability and avoids clutter  

Switch is especially useful for menus, category-based logic, day/month selection, command processing, and similar tasks where one value determines the result.

## Example – Days of the Week

### Using `if-else-if` (Lengthy and repetitive)

```java
int n = 1;

if (n == 1)
    System.out.println("Monday");
else if (n == 2)
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
else if (n == 3)
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
else if (n == 4)
    System.out.println("Thursday");
else if (n == 5)
    System.out.println("Friday");
else if (n == 6)
    System.out.println("Saturday");
else if (n == 7)
    System.out.println("Sunday");
else
    System.out.println("Invalid Day");
````

### Why this is not ideal?

* You repeat the variable (`n`) in every condition
* The code grows longer with each new case
* Harder to scan visually
* Inefficient structure when conditions depend on the same variable

## Using `switch` (Cleaner and more readable)

```java
int n = 1;

switch (n) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");
        break;
    case 5:
        System.out.println("Friday");
        break;
    case 6:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid Day");
}
```

### Why this is better?

* Only the values change inside each `case`, not the entire condition
* Code looks structured and grouped
* Easy to add, modify, or remove cases
* Clear separation of each possible output

## Key Points

### 1. Use of `break`

Whenever a matching case is found, the statements inside that case run.
However, if there is **no `break`**, the execution does not stop and continues into the next case—even if that case does not match.
This behavior is called **fall-through**.

Example:

```java
int n = 1;
switch (n) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
}
```

Output:

```
Monday
Tuesday
```

This happens because:

* Case 1 matches and prints “Monday”
* No `break`, so execution falls through to case 2
* Case 2 prints “Tuesday” even though the value does not match

### Why fall-through can be risky?

* It may produce unexpected output
* Beginners often forget `break`, causing logical errors
* Code becomes harder to predict

But fall-through can be intentionally used for grouping cases (e.g., common output for multiple cases).

### 2. Use of `default`

The `default` block acts like the `else` in an if-else structure.
It runs when **none of the cases match** the value provided to the switch.

Example:

```java
int n = 9;

switch (n) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid Day");
}
```

Output:

```
Invalid Day
```

### Why `default` is important?

* Ensures your program handles incorrect or unexpected input
* Prevents the switch block from doing nothing when no case matches
* Helps maintain reliability and user-friendly error messages


## Summary

* `switch` is much cleaner than writing multiple `if-else-if` conditions.
* Always include a **break** to prevent fall-through (unless intentionally required).
* The **default** case ensures the program behaves correctly for invalid or unhandled values.
* Switch is ideal when decisions depend on **a single variable**, especially when the values are distinct and known.
