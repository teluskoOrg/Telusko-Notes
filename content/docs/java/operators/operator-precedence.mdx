title: Operator Precedence
---

## 1. Introduction

In Java, an expression can contain many operators at the same time.  
For example:

```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2 - 3;
```

How does Java decide:

* Which operator to evaluate first?
* In which direction to evaluate when operators have the same precedence?

This is controlled by:

* **Operator precedence** → decides which operator goes first
* **Associativity** → decides the direction (left-to-right or right-to-left) for operators of the same precedence

Understanding operator precedence is important to:

* Predict the output of expressions
* Avoid unexpected results
* Write clear and maintainable code (often with parentheses)

## 2. What Is Operator Precedence?

Operator precedence is a **set of rules** that decide which operator is evaluated first when multiple operators appear in a single expression.

Example:

```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2;
```

Here:

* `*` has **higher precedence** than `+`
* So `5 * 2` is evaluated first → `10`
* Then `10 + 10` → `20`

If you want `10 + 5` to happen first, you must use parentheses:

```java
int result = (10 + 5) * 2; // 30
```

## 3. What Is Associativity?

Associativity decides **the direction** of evaluation when **operators with the same precedence** appear together.

Example:

```java
int x = 10 - 5 - 2;
```

`-` has **left-to-right associativity**, so:

* First: `10 - 5 = 5`
* Then: `5 - 2 = 3`

If it were right-to-left, result would be `10 - (5 - 2) = 7`, which is not how Java works for `-`.

Most operators in Java are **left-to-right associative**, except:

* Unary operators: `++`, `--`, `+`, `-`, `~`, `!`
* Ternary operator: `?:`
* Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

These have **right-to-left associativity**.

## 4. Operator Precedence Table (High to Low)

From **highest** precedence (evaluated first) to **lowest** (evaluated last):

| Level | Category       | Operators                                                                     | Associativity |
| ----: | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
|     1 | Postfix        | `expr++`, `expr--`                                                            | Left to right |

## 5. Examples of Precedence in Action

### 5.1 Arithmetic with Different Operators

```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 4;
```

Step-by-step:

* Multiplicative first: `5 * 2 = 10`, `8 / 4 = 2`
* Now expression becomes: `10 + 10 - 2`
* Left to right: `10 + 10 = 20`
* Then: `20 - 2 = 18`

Final result: `18`


### 5.2 With Parentheses

```java
int result = (10 + 5) * (20 - 8) / 4;
```

Steps:

* `(10 + 5) = 15`
* `(20 - 8) = 12`
* Expression: `15 * 12 / 4`
* Multiplicative left to right: `15 * 12 = 180`
* Then `180 / 4 = 45`

Result: `45`

Parentheses always override precedence rules.

## 6. Precedence with Relational and Logical Operators

```java
int a = 10, b = 20, c = 5;
boolean result = a < b && b > c || c > a;
```

Order:

1. Relational operators first:

   * `a < b` → `10 < 20` → `true`
   * `b > c` → `20 > 5` → `true`
   * `c > a` → `5 > 10` → `false`
2. Now expression: `true && true || false`
3. `&&` has higher precedence than `||`, so:

   * `true && true` → `true`
4. Now: `true || false` → `true`

Final result: `true`

## 7. Precedence and Assignment

Assignment has the **lowest precedence** (evaluated near the end), and is **right-to-left associative**.

Example:

```java
int a, b, c;
a = b = c = 10;
```

This is evaluated as:

* `b = c = 10;`
* First `c = 10` → `c` becomes 10
* Then `b = c` → `b` becomes 10
* Then `a = b` → `a` becomes 10

All three variables become 10.

## 8. Precedence in Ternary Operator

Ternary operator `?:` has low precedence but higher than assignment.

```java
int a = 10, b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
```

Here:

* Relational `>` evaluated first
* Then ternary `?:`
* Finally assignment `=`

If you write:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
int result = x > y ? x + 10 : y + 10;
```

The expressions `x + 10` and `y + 10` are evaluated based on the condition `x > y`.

## 9. Complex Expression Example

Consider:

```java
int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;
int result = a + b * c > 100 && b < c || a == 5;
```

Step-by-step:

1. Multiplicative: `b * c = 10 * 15 = 150`
2. Additive: `a + 150 = 5 + 150 = 155`
3. Relational: `155 > 100` → `true`
   Also: `b < c` → `10 < 15` → `true`
   And: `a == 5` → `true`
4. Logical AND first: `true && true` → `true`
5. Logical OR: `true || true` → `true`

Final result: `true`

## 10. Best Practices

* Do not rely too heavily on remembering all precedence rules for very complex expressions.
* Use **parentheses** to make expressions clear and explicit.
* Keep expressions **simple** and readable.
* When in doubt, break expressions into multiple lines:

```java
int temp = a + b * c;
boolean cond = temp > 100 && b < c;
boolean result = cond || a == 5;
```

This is easier to read, debug, and maintain.

## 11. Summary

* Operator precedence decides **which operator is evaluated first**.
* Associativity decides **the direction of evaluation** when precedence is the same.
* Most operators are **left-to-right associative**, but unary, ternary, and assignment are **right-to-left**.
* Parentheses can always be used to **override precedence** and improve readability.
* Understanding precedence helps predict and control complex expression behavior in Java.
