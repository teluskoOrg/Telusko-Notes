title: Assignment Operators
---

## 1. Introduction

Assignment operators in Java are used to **assign values to variables**.  
The most commonly used assignment operator is `=`, but Java provides several **compound assignment operators** that simplify expressions and make code cleaner.

Assignment operators help you:

- Update variable values efficiently  
- Reduce repetitive code  
- Perform arithmetic and assignment in one step  
- Improve readability in loops and calculations  

This document explains each assignment operator with examples.



## 2. Basic Assignment Operator (`=`)

This operator assigns the value on the **right-hand side** (RHS) to the **left-hand side** (LHS) variable.

### Syntax:

```java
variable = value;
```

### Example:

```java
int x = 10;
String name = "John";
```



## 3. Compound Assignment Operators

Compound operators perform an operation and assignment **in a single step**.

Example:

```java
x = x + 5;
```

Can be written as:

```java
x += 5;
```

### List of Compound Assignment Operators

| Operator | Meaning                         | Example               | Equivalent To |      |        |    |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---- | ------ | -- |
| `+=`     | Add and assign                  | `x += 5`              | `x = x + 5`   |      |        |    |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign             | `x -= 3`              | `x = x - 3`   |      |        |    |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign             | `x *= 2`              | `x = x * 2`   |      |        |    |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign               | `x /= 4`              | `x = x / 4`   |      |        |    |
| `%=`     | Modulo and assign               | `x %= 2`              | `x = x % 2`   |      |        |    |
| `&=`     | Bitwise AND and assign          | `x &= 3`              | `x = x & 3`   |      |        |    |
| `^=`     | Bitwise XOR and assign          | `x ^= 6`              | `x = x ^ 6`   |      |        |    |
| `<<=`    | Left shift and assign           | `x <<= 1`             | `x = x << 1`  |      |        |    |
| `>>=`    | Right shift and assign          | `x >>= 1`             | `x = x >> 1`  |      |        |    |
| `>>>=`   | Unsigned right shift and assign | `x >>>= 2`            | `x = x >>> 2` |      |        |    |

## 4. Detailed Examples

### 4.1 Addition Assignment (`+=`)

```java
int x = 10;
x += 5; 
```

Now:

```
x = 15
```



### 4.2 Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)

```java
int x = 20;
x -= 4;
```

Now:

```
x = 16
```



### 4.3 Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)

```java
int x = 7;
x *= 3;
```

Now:

```
x = 21
```



### 4.4 Division Assignment (`/=`)

```java
int x = 40;
x /= 5;
```

Now:

```
x = 8
```



### 4.5 Modulus Assignment (`%=`)

```java
int x = 13;
x %= 5;
```

Now:

```
x = 3
```



## 5. Bitwise Assignment Operators

These work at the bit level.

### Example:

```java
int x = 6;   // binary: 110
x &= 3;     // binary: 011
```

Now:

```
x = 2   // binary: 010
```



## 6. Shift Assignment Operators

Used to shift bits to the left or right.

### Left shift:

```java
int x = 4;   // 0100
x <<= 1;     // becomes 1000
```

Now:

```
x = 8
```

### Right shift:

```java
int x = 16; // 10000
x >>= 2;    // becomes 00010
```

Now:

```
x = 4
```

## 7. Real-World Use Cases

### Loop counters

```java
i += 2; // increment by 2
```

### Summations

```java
sum += value;
```

### Reducing repetitive arithmetic

```java
total -= discount;
balance *= rate;
```

### Working with bitwise flags

```java
permissions |= READ;
permissions &= ~WRITE;
```



## 8. Common Mistakes

* Using `/=` with integers (may cause integer division)
* Forgetting type limitations with `+=` on small types (e.g., byte/short)
* Confusing `x += y` with `x =+ y` (which assigns positive value)

Bad:

```java
x =+ 5; // means x = +5, not x += 5
```



## 9. Summary

* Assignment operators simplify updating variable values.
* `=` is the basic operator; others combine arithmetic and assignment.
* Compound operators help write cleaner and shorter code.
* Bitwise and shift assignment operators are useful for performance and low-level programming.
* Understanding assignment operators is essential for loops, conditions, and calculations.
