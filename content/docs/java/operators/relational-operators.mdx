Relational operators are used to **compare two values**.  
They form the foundation of decision-making in Java.  
Every comparison performed using these operators results in a **boolean value** — either `true` or `false`.

These operators are widely used in conditions, loops, filtering logic, and anywhere you need to make a choice based on data.


## What are Relational Operators?

Relational operators allow us to check:

- Is one value greater than another?
- Are two values equal?
- Are they different?
- Is a value within a certain range?

The result of these comparisons determines the flow of your program.

Example:

```java
int x = 6;
int y = 5;

boolean result = x > y; // true
```

This boolean value is often used inside `if`, `while`, or other conditional statements.


## List of Relational Operators

Java provides six relational operators:

| Operator | Meaning            | Example (`x=6, y=5`) | Result |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| `<`      | Less than          | `x < y`  → `6 < 5`   | false  |
| `>`      | Greater than       | `x > y`  → `6 > 5`   | true   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal | `x <= y` → `6 <= 5`  | false  |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal   | `x >= y` → `6 >= 5`  | true   |
| `==`     | Equal to           | `x == y` → `6 == 5`  | false  |
| `!=`     | Not equal to       | `x != y` → `6 != 5`  | true   |

### Important Notes About `==`

* `==` checks **value equality**, not assignment.
* It compares whether the two values are the same.
* In contrast, `=` is the assignment operator (stores a value).


## Example Program

Here’s a complete Java program demonstrating relational operators:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 6;
        int y = 5;

        boolean r1 = x < y;
        boolean r2 = x >= y;
        boolean r3 = x != y;
        boolean r4 = (x == y);

        System.out.println("x < y : " + r1);
        System.out.println("x >= y: " + r2);
        System.out.println("x != y: " + r3);
        System.out.println("x == y: " + r4);
    }
}
```

### Output

```
x < y : false
x >= y: true
x != y: true
x == y: false
```

## When Are Relational Operators Used?

Relational operators are essential in:

* **if / else conditions**
* **while loops**
* **for loops**
* **switch conditions (indirectly)**
* **filtering data**
* **validations (age, limits, boundaries)**

Example inside a condition:

```java
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater");
}
```

## Key Notes (Recap)

* Relational operators always return **true** or **false**.
* `==` compares values, not assignment.
* Commonly used in decision-making statements.
* Play a crucial role in controlling program flow.
