Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data in Java.  
They form the foundation for calculations, logic building, loops, and data processing.  
Understanding how these operators behave—especially with integers—is essential for writing correct programs.


## Basic Arithmetic Operators

Java supports several arithmetic operators that work on integer, float, and double values.  
The most common ones include:

- `+`  → Addition  
- `-`  → Subtraction  
- `*`  → Multiplication  
- `/`  → Division  
- `%`  → Modulus (remainder)

### Example:

```java
int num1 = 7;
int num2 = 5;

int add = num1 + num2;   // Addition → 12
int sub = num1 - num2;   // Subtraction → 2
int mul = num1 * num2;   // Multiplication → 35
int div = num1 / num2;   // Division → 1 (integer division)
int mod = num1 % num2;   // Modulus → 2

System.out.println(add);
System.out.println(sub);
System.out.println(mul);
System.out.println(div);
System.out.println(mod);
````

### Important Note About Integer Division

When both operands are integers, Java performs **integer division**, meaning:

* Decimal values are discarded
* Result is always an integer

Example:
`7 / 5 = 1` → the result is not 1.4, but **1**

This is a frequent source of confusion among beginners.


## Assignment with Operators (Shorthand Operators)

Java provides shorthand versions of common assignment operations to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

### Example:

```java
int num1 = 7;

num1 += 2;   // num1 = num1 + 2  → 9
num1 -= 2;   // num1 = num1 - 2  → 7
num1 *= 2;   // num1 = num1 * 2  → 14
num1 /= 2;   // num1 = num1 / 2  → 7
```

### Why use shorthand operators?

* They are shorter and cleaner
* Reduce repetition
* More readable in loops and calculations

These operators work for **all numeric types** (int, float, double, etc.).


## Increment and Decrement Operators

Java provides two operators to increase or decrease a value by 1:

* **Increment:** `++`
* **Decrement:** `--`

Each operator has two forms:

### • Post-Increment (num++)

Uses the value first, then increments.

### • Pre-Increment (++num)

Increments first, then uses the value.

### • Post-Decrement (num--)

Uses the value, then decrements.

### • Pre-Decrement (--num)

Decrements first, then uses the value.

### Example:

```java
int num = 5;

System.out.println(num++); // Output: 5, then num becomes 6
System.out.println(++num); // num becomes 7, then prints 7

System.out.println(num--); // Prints 7, then becomes 6
System.out.println(--num); // Becomes 5, then prints 5
```

### Why does this matter?

Pre/post increment behavior is very important when working with:

* Loops
* Complex expressions
* Indexing arrays
* Algorithm logic

Beginners often confuse pre-increment and post-increment, so always be mindful of when the change happens.


## Division Notes (Integer vs Float)

If **either** operand is a floating-point number (float or double), Java performs **floating-point division**.

Example:

```java
System.out.println(7 / 5);    // 1   (integer division)
System.out.println(7 / 5.0);  // 1.4 (floating division)
```

Java automatically promotes the calculation to a wider type if necessary.


## Key Points Recap

* `%` (modulus) returns the remainder of a division operation.
* Integer division **removes decimals** — it does not round.
* `++` and `--` behave differently depending on their position (pre vs post).
* Shorthand operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) help make code cleaner and more readable.
* Use floating-point numbers to get decimal results in division.
