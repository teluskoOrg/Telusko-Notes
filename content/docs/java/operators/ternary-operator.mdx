## What is the Ternary Operator?

The **ternary operator** provides a compact way to write an `if-else` statement in a single line.  
It is most useful when you need to **assign a value based on a condition**.

It uses three components (hence the name “ternary”):  
`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`

### Syntax

```java
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

This expression evaluates to either the value after `?` or the value after `:` depending on the condition.

## Example 1 – Without Ternary

```java
int n = 4;
int result = 0;

if (n % 2 == 0)
    result = 10;
else
    result = 20;

System.out.println(result);   // Output: 10
```

This approach works, but it is lengthy for simple decisions.

## Example 2 – With Ternary (Cleaner)

```java
int n = 4;
int result = 0;

result = (n % 2 == 0) ? 10 : 20;

System.out.println(result);   // Output: 10
```

The same logic is written more compactly and cleanly.

## How It Works

* When the **condition is true**, Java selects the expression immediately after `?`.
* When the **condition is false**, Java selects the expression after `:`.

This makes ternary ideal for short, simple conditions where readability is maintained.

## Example 3 – Maximum of Two Numbers

```java
int a = 8, b = 5;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

System.out.println("Maximum: " + max); // Output: 8
```

A very common and clean use case of ternary.

## Example 4 – Nested Ternary (Use Carefully)

```java
int marks = 75;
String grade = (marks >= 90) ? "A" :
               (marks >= 75) ? "B" :
               (marks >= 50) ? "C" : "Fail";

System.out.println("Grade: " + grade); // Output: B
```

Nested ternaries are possible but can make the code harder to read if overused.

## Key Notes

* Ternary operator helps simplify short decision-making expressions.
* It improves readability when used for **simple** conditions.
* Avoid creating overly complex or deeply nested ternary expressions — they reduce clarity.
* Prefer ternary primarily for **value assignment**, not long logical decisions.
