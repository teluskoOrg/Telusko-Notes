<Video id="hLimYJZQ2kc" />

Logical and bitwise operators are essential tools in Java for building decision-making logic, validating conditions, and performing low-level operations on binary data.  
This lecture explains how they work, where they are used, and the difference between short-circuit and non-short-circuit operators.

## 1. Logical Operators (Work on boolean values)

Logical operators operate **only on boolean expressions** and always produce a boolean output (`true` or `false`).  
They are commonly used in **if-conditions, loops, validations, and comparisons**.

Here is the rewritten section with **simple bullet points instead of a table**, keeping the meaning clear and beginner-friendly:


### Available Logical Operators

* **`&&` – Logical AND (short-circuit)**
  Evaluates to `true` only if **both** conditions are true.
  **Example:**
  `(x < y && a > b)` → `false`

* **`||` – Logical OR (short-circuit)**
  Evaluates to `true` if **any one** condition is true.
  **Example:**
  `(x < y || a > b)` → `true`

* **`!` – Logical NOT**
  Reverses a boolean value.
  **Example:**
  `!(x < y)` → `true`


### Logical AND – `&&` (Short-Circuit)

- Returns **true** only when **both** conditions are true.
- **Short-circuit behavior:**  
  If the **first condition is false**, Java **does not evaluate the second**, because the final result is already false.

### Logical OR – `||` (Short-Circuit)

- Returns **true** if **any one** condition is true.
- **Short-circuit behavior:**  
  If the **first condition is true**, Java **skips the second condition** since the final result is guaranteed to be true.

### Logical NOT – `!`

- Reverses a boolean value:  
  `!true → false`  
  `!false → true`


## 2. `&` vs `&&` and `|` vs `||`

Java has two versions of AND and OR:

### AND Operators

#### `&&` – Logical AND (short-circuit)
- Skips evaluation of second condition if first is false.
- More efficient, safer (avoids errors like dividing by zero).

#### `&` – Non-short-circuit AND
- **Always evaluates both conditions**, even if first is false.
- Also used as a **bitwise operator** when dealing with numbers.


### OR Operators

#### `||` – Logical OR (short-circuit)
- Skips second condition if first is true.

#### `|` – Non-short-circuit OR
- Always evaluates both conditions.
- Also used as a **bitwise OR** operator.


### Example

```java
int a = 10, b = 5;

System.out.println(a > b && a < 20); // true (short-circuit AND)
System.out.println(a > b & a < 20);  // true (both checked)

System.out.println(a > b || a < 2);  // true (short-circuit OR)
System.out.println(a > b | a < 2);   // true (both checked)
```

## 3. Bitwise Operators (Work on binary digits)

Bitwise operators operate on the **individual bits** of numbers.
They are useful for performance-critical tasks, binary manipulation, encryption, and low-level operations.

### Bitwise operators:

* `&` → Bitwise AND
* `|` → Bitwise OR
* `^` → Bitwise XOR
* `~` → Bitwise NOT
* `<<` → Left Shift
* `>>` → Right Shift

### Example Program

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5, b = 3;

        System.out.println("a & b: " + (a & b));   // 1
        System.out.println("a | b: " + (a | b));   // 7
        System.out.println("a ^ b: " + (a ^ b));   // 6
        System.out.println("~a: " + (~a));         // -6
        System.out.println("a << 1: " + (a << 1)); // 10
        System.out.println("a >> 1: " + (a >> 1)); // 2
    }
}
```

### Explanation (Binary View)

```
a = 5 → 0101
b = 3 → 0011

a & b → 0001 (1)
a | b → 0111 (7)
a ^ b → 0110 (6)
~a    → -(a+1) = -6
```

Shift operators:

* `a << 1` shifts bits left → multiply by 2
* `a >> 1` shifts bits right → divide by 2

## 4. Truth Tables

### Logical AND (`&&`)

| x | y | x && y |
| - | - | ------ |
| T | T | T      |
| T | F | F      |
| F | T | F      |
| F | F | F      |


### Logical OR (`||`)

* `T || T` → **T**
* `T || F` → **T**
* `F || T` → **T**
* `F || F` → **F**


## Key Notes Recap

* `&&` and `||` are **short-circuit** operators.
* `&` and `|` always evaluate **both sides** (also used in bitwise operations).
* Bitwise operators manipulate values at the **binary** level.
* Logical operators work only on **boolean values**.
* Bitwise operators work on **numeric types** (int, byte, long).
