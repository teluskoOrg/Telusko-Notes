## Checking Installation in VS Code Terminal

Before writing your first program, it’s important to verify that Java has been installed correctly and that VS Code can detect it.  
Open the **VS Code integrated terminal** and run:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

If everything is set up correctly, both commands will display version numbers.
`java` refers to the Java Runtime, while `javac` refers to the Java Compiler.

<Callout type="info">
Both commands must work.  
If <b>javac</b> fails, your JDK is not properly installed or JAVA_HOME is not configured.
</Callout>


## Creating Your First Java File

Every Java program begins with a `.java` file.
Create a new file named:

**Hello.java**

A few important rules:

* Every Java source file must end with `.java`
* If your file contains a **public class**, the filename must match that class name

This is why we name the file **Hello.java** when our class is named `Hello`.

<Callout type="info">
In Java, the filename and the public class name must match.  
This helps the compiler organize and locate your code.
</Callout>


## JShell (Interactive Mode)

JShell is Java's **interactive REPL environment**, introduced in Java 9.
It allows you to quickly test small code snippets without creating files, compiling, or running a full program.

This makes JShell perfect for beginners experimenting with syntax or performing quick calculations.

### Open JShell

```bash
jshell
```

### Try basic expressions

```bash
2 + 3            // Output: 5
9 - 6            // Output: 3
print(6)         // Error
System.out.print(6)
System.out.println("Hello World")
```

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why does print(6) give an error?">
    Java does not have a global <code>print()</code> function.  
    All printing must be done using the <code>System.out</code> object.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>


## Compiling and Running Code

Inside JShell, you can enter single lines of Java code.
But to write real programs, you must place your code inside a class and compile it.

For example, this line works in JShell:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

But placing only this line into **Hello.java** will cause an error.

<Callout type="warning">
If <b>Hello.java</b> contains only a print statement, it will fail to compile.  
Java requires all code to be inside a class.
</Callout>

### Compile the program

```bash
javac Hello.java
```

If the file is missing a class structure, the compiler will report errors and stop.


## Minimal Working Java Program

Here is the simplest valid Java program you can write:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

* `public class Hello` defines the class
* `main()` is the entry point — the first method executed by the JVM
* `System.out.println()` prints output to the screen

### Compile and run:

```bash
javac Hello.java
java Hello
```

If everything is correct, you should see:

```
Hello World
```

Congratulations — you have run your first Java program!
