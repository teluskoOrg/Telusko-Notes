title: Comments
---

## 1. Introduction

Comments are notes written inside a Java program for developers.  
They are **ignored by the compiler** and do not affect program execution.

Comments help you:

- Explain code logic  
- Increase readability  
- Document complex logic  
- Disable code temporarily  
- Communicate with other developers  

Java supports **three types of comments**:

1. **Single-line comment**  
2. **Multi-line comment**  
3. **Documentation comment (JavaDoc)**

This document explains each with examples, use-cases, and best practices.


## 2. Why Are Comments Important?

Good code becomes great when it is easy to understand.  
Comments help:

- Clarify complex logic  
- Make team collaboration easier  
- Provide quick explanations for future maintenance  
- Describe class/method usage through JavaDoc  

However, comments should **support** code, not replace proper naming or structure.


## 3. Types of Comments in Java


## 3.1 Single-Line Comment (`//`)

Used for short explanations.

Syntax:

```java
// This is a single-line comment
```

Example:

```java
int marks = 90; // storing marks
```

Use cases:

* Quick notes
* Inline explanations
* Disabling a single statement

## 3.2 Multi-Line Comment (`/* ... */`)

Used for longer descriptions that span multiple lines.

Syntax:

```java
/* 
   This is a 
   multi-line comment
*/
```

Example:

```java
/* 
  Calculate the area of a circle.
  Formula: πr² 
*/
double area = 3.14 * r * r;
```

Use cases:

* Describing logic blocks
* Adding detailed explanations
* Temporarily disabling code sections

## 3.3 Documentation Comment (`/** ... */`)

Documentation comments are used to generate **JavaDoc**, which creates HTML documentation automatically.

Syntax:

```java
/**
 * This is a documentation comment.
 */
```

Example:

```java
/**
 * Adds two numbers and returns the result.
 * @param a first number
 * @param b second number
 * @return sum of a and b
 */
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Use cases:

* Documenting methods, classes, and fields
* Auto-generating API documentation
* Providing parameter and return descriptions

### JavaDoc Tags

| Tag        | Purpose                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| `@param`   | Describes a method parameter  |
| `@return`  | Describes return value        |
| `@author`  | Specifies author              |
| `@version` | Specifies version             |
| `@since`   | Indicates since which version |
| `@throws`  | Describes exceptions thrown   |

## 4. Disabling Code Using Comments

Sometimes, developers disable code temporarily for testing.

Example:

```java
// int result = multiply(a, b);  // temporarily disabled
```

Or using multi-line comments:

```java
/*
System.out.println("debug output");
System.out.println("more logs");
*/
```

**Note:** Avoid leaving unnecessary disabled code in production.


## 5. Best Practices for Comments

###  Write meaningful comments

Bad:

```java
// incrementing i
i++;
```

Good:

```java
// Increasing loop counter to move to the next element
i++;
```

###  Avoid obvious comments

Bad:

```java
int x = 10; // x is equal to 10
```

###  Keep code clean instead of over-commenting

If variable names are clear, comments often become unnecessary.

###  Use single-line comments for short explanations

###  Use multi-line comments for detailed blocks

###  Use JavaDoc for classes, methods, and APIs

## 6. Examples

### Example 1: All Comment Types Together

```java
/**
 * This class represents a student entity.
 */
class Student {

    // instance variables
    String name;
    int age;

    /**
     * Prints student details.
     * @return nothing
     */
    void displayDetails() {
        /* Printing both values
           using a single statement
        */
        System.out.println(name + " - " + age);
    }
}
```

## 7. Common Mistakes

* Over-commenting obvious code
* Keeping outdated comments
* Using comments to hide poor code structure
* Forgetting to update comments after modifying logic


## 8. Summary

* Java provides **single-line**, **multi-line**, and **documentation** comments.
* Comments improve code readability and maintainability.
* JavaDoc comments help generate official documentation.
* Use comments wisely—clarify logic, but avoid over-explaining obvious code.
