title: JDK, JRE, JVM
---


## 1. Introduction

Java is a platform-independent programming language.
This independence is achieved because Java programs do not run directly on your operating system; instead, they run inside a virtual machine — the **JVM**.
To understand how Java works internally, you must clearly understand three important components:

* **JDK – Java Development Kit**
* **JRE – Java Runtime Environment**
* **JVM – Java Virtual Machine**

These three work together to allow **writing**, **compiling**, and **running** Java applications.


## 2. What is JVM? (Java Virtual Machine)

### Definition

The JVM is a **virtual computer** inside your real computer.
It is responsible for **executing Java bytecode**.

### Key Responsibilities of JVM

1. Loads the `.class` file (Class Loader subsystem)
2. Verifies bytecode (Bytecode Verifier)
3. Executes bytecode (Interpreter + JIT Compiler)
4. Provides memory management (Heap, Stack, Method Area)
5. Runs garbage collection

### Internal Working of JVM

When you type:

```bash
java MyProgram
```

This is what happens internally:

1. Class loader loads `MyProgram.class`
2. Bytecode is verified for safety
3. Interpreter converts bytecode → machine code
4. JIT compiler optimizes frequently used code
5. Garbage collector removes unused objects


## JVM Memory Structure

JVM memory is divided into sections:

### 1. Method Area

Stores:

* Class metadata
* Static variables
* Constant pool
* Method code

### 2. Heap Area

Stores objects and instance variables.

### 3. Stack Area

Stores method calls, local variables, references.

### 4. PC Register

Tracks the current instruction.

### 5. Native Method Stack

Stores native (e.g., C/C++) calls.

## 3. What is JRE? (Java Runtime Environment)

### Definition

JRE is the **environment needed to run Java programs**.
It includes:

* JVM
* Core Java class libraries (String, Math, Collection, IO, etc.)
* Java supporting files

### What JRE Does

If you only need to **run** Java applications (not write them), installing the JRE is enough.

#### JRE = JDK – (Compiler + Development tools)

### Example Scenario

If you only want to run a Java-based software like Eclipse or Minecraft, you only need the JRE.


## 4. What is JDK? (Java Development Kit)

### Definition

JDK is the **complete Java development package** used to build Java applications.

It includes:

* **JRE** (JVM + Libraries)
* **Compiler** → `javac`
* **Debugger** → `jdb`
* **Documentation tool** → `javadoc`
* **Packaging tool** → `jar`
* **Profiler** → `jconsole`, `jvisualvm`

In simple words:

#### JDK = JRE + Development Tools

### Example Commands in JDK

#### Compile a Java program

```bash
javac Hello.java
```

#### Run the program

```bash
java Hello
```

#### Create documentation

```bash
javadoc Hello.java
```

## 5. Differences Between JDK, JRE, JVM

| Feature           | JVM                   | JRE                | JDK                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Purpose           | Executes bytecode     | Runs Java programs | Develops Java programs |
| Contains          | JVM only              | JVM + libraries    | JRE + compiler + tools |
| For developers?   | No                    | No                 | Yes                    |
| For running apps? | Yes                   | Yes                | Yes                    |
| Components        | GC, Class Loader, JIT | JVM, libraries     | JRE + javac + tools    |


## 6. Which One Should You Install?

If you want to **run** Java programs → Install **JRE**
If you want to **develop** Java programs → Install **JDK**

(because JDK already contains the JRE)

In modern Java versions, JRE is no longer distributed separately.
Now **JDK includes everything**.


## 7. Real-World Example

Consider the following Java program:

```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}
```

### Step-by-step execution:

1. You write code → JDK
2. Code is compiled into bytecode `.class` → `javac`
3. Bytecode is executed by JVM → `java` command
4. JRE provides libraries → System.out.println
5. JVM converts bytecode → machine code
6. CPU runs the final machine code


## 8. Why Java Is Platform Independent

* Source code → compiled once into **bytecode**
* Bytecode → runs on **any JVM**
* JVM is platform-dependent (Windows JVM, Mac JVM, Linux JVM)
* But bytecode is platform-independent

Therefore:
"Write Once, Run Anywhere" = Java Philosophy

## 9. Interview Questions

<Accordions>

  <Accordion id="q1" title="What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?">
    JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to develop Java applications. It contains JRE + compilers + development tools.
    JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required only to run Java programs. It contains JVM + core libraries.
    JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing Java bytecode.
    Relationship: JDK → JRE → JVM
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="q2" title="Why is Java platform independent?">
    Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is not machine-specific.
    The bytecode runs on the JVM, and every operating system has its own JVM implementation.
    Since the same bytecode can run on any JVM, Java is platform independent.
    Hence: Write Once, Run Anywhere.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="q3" title="What is bytecode?">
    Bytecode is the intermediate code generated by the Java compiler (javac).
    It is stored in .class files and executed by the JVM.
    Bytecode is platform independent, making Java portable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="q4" title="What is the role of the class loader?">
    The class loader is a subsystem of the JVM responsible for:
    - Loading the required .class files into memory  
    - Verifying bytecode for safety  
    - Linking and preparing classes  
    - Using hierarchical loaders (Bootstrap, Extension, Application ClassLoaders)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="q5" title="What is JIT compiler?">
    JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is a part of the JVM that improves performance.
    It converts frequently executed bytecode into native machine code for faster execution.
    JIT activates during runtime and works alongside the interpreter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="q6" title="Does JDK contain JVM?">
    Yes. JDK includes:
    - Development tools (javac, javadoc, jar, debugger)  
    - JRE  
    - JVM  
    So installing JDK automatically gives you both JVM and JRE.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion id="q7" title="What happens when we type ‘java Hello’?">
    1. JVM searches for Hello.class  
    2. Class Loader loads the class into memory  
    3. Bytecode verifier checks instructions for security  
    4. JVM calls main() method  
    5. Interpreter and JIT execute bytecode  
    6. Output is displayed on the console  
  </Accordion>

</Accordions>



## 10. Summary

* **JVM** runs Java programs by translating bytecode to machine code.
* **JRE** provides libraries + JVM needed to run Java applications.
* **JDK** provides everything needed to **develop** Java applications — including JRE + tools.
* Java is platform-independent due to its bytecode and JVM.
