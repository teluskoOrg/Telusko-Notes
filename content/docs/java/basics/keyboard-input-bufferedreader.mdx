title: Keyboard Input Using BufferedReader in Java
---

## 1. Introduction

Before the Scanner class was introduced (Java 5), **BufferedReader** was the most common way to read keyboard input in Java.  
Many legacy applications, competitive programming environments, and high-performance systems still prefer **BufferedReader** due to its speed.

BufferedReader is faster than Scanner because:

- It reads data **as raw text**.
- It does not perform automatic parsing.
- It buffers input, reducing I/O operations.

BufferedReader is part of the **java.io** package.


## 2. Importing BufferedReader

To use BufferedReader, you must import:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
````

BufferedReader needs **InputStreamReader**, which reads bytes from keyboard and converts them into characters.


## 3. Creating a BufferedReader Object

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```

Explanation:

* `System.in` → reads bytes from keyboard
* `InputStreamReader` → converts bytes → characters
* `BufferedReader` → reads characters efficiently

## 4. Reading Input with BufferedReader

BufferedReader reads **strings only** using:

```java
String input = br.readLine();
```

To read numbers, you must **convert** the string manually.


## 5. Reading a String

```java
System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
String name = br.readLine();
System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
```


## 6. Reading an Integer

Since BufferedReader reads only text, convert using `Integer.parseInt()`.

```java
System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
```

## 7. Reading a Double

```java
System.out.print("Enter your salary: ");
double salary = Double.parseDouble(br.readLine());
```

## 8. Reading a Character

BufferedReader does not have `readChar()`, so you extract the first char.

```java
System.out.print("Enter your grade: ");
char grade = br.readLine().charAt(0);
```

## 9. Handling Exceptions

`readLine()` throws a **checked exception** → IOException.
Hence, you must use **try-catch** or **throws**.

### Method 1: Using throws

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String name = br.readLine();
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

### Method 2: Using try-catch

```java
try {
    String name = br.readLine();
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error reading input");
}
```

## 10. Closing BufferedReader

Although optional for console I/O, closing is a good practice.

```java
br.close();
```

But avoid closing `System.in` in larger applications, as it cannot be reopened.


## 11. Full Example Program

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        System.out.print("Enter name: ");
        String name = br.readLine();

        System.out.print("Enter age: ");
        int age = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

        System.out.print("Enter salary: ");
        double salary = Double.parseDouble(br.readLine());

        System.out.print("Enter grade (A/B/C): ");
        char grade = br.readLine().charAt(0);

        System.out.println("\n--- User Details ---");
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);

        br.close();
    }
}
```


## 12. BufferedReader vs Scanner — Comparison

| Feature    | BufferedReader            | Scanner                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Speed      | Faster                    | Slower (parsing overhead)     |
| Input Type | Reads **Strings only**    | Reads all data types directly |
| Conversion | Manual parsing required   | Automatic parsing             |
| Used For   | Performance-critical apps | Simple input programs         |
| Exception  | Requires try/catch        | No mandatory exception        |


## 13. Summary

* BufferedReader is a fast and efficient way to read input.
* It works with `readLine()` to read text.
* You need to manually convert Strings to numbers.
* Works well for large input or competitive programming.
* Must handle exceptions using `try-catch` or `throws`.
