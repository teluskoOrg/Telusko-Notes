Understanding data types is one of the most important fundamentals of Java.  
Every piece of data you store must have a clearly defined type, and this helps Java maintain consistency, efficiency, and safety in your programs.

Java divides its data types into two main categories:

1. **Primitive Data Types** – these are the basic, built-in data types.  
2. **Non-Primitive Data Types** – these include classes, arrays, strings, and objects created using classes.

In this lecture, we focus entirely on **Primitive Data Types**, which serve as the building blocks for all other types.


## Primitive Data Types

Primitive types are simple, efficient, and stored directly in memory.  
They represent the most basic forms of data that Java can handle and are divided into **four major groups** based on the kind of values they store.


## 1. Integer Types

Integer types store **whole numbers**, both positive and negative.  
Java provides four different integer types, each designed for different memory constraints and ranges.

| Type  | Size    | Range                                                   |
|-------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| byte  | 1 byte  | -128 to 127                                             |
| short | 2 bytes | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| int   | 4 bytes | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| long  | 8 bytes | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

### Notes

- `int` is the most commonly used integer type.
- `byte` and `short` are used when memory is very limited (e.g., embedded systems).
- `long` requires an **L** at the end of the value, otherwise Java treats numbers as `int` by default.

### Example

```java
int num1 = 9;
byte by = 127;        // Max value for byte
short sh = 558;
long l = 5584L;       // Must end with 'L'
```


## 2. Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types store decimal numbers.
They are useful for mathematical operations, scientific calculations, and any situation requiring fractional values.

| Type   | Size    | Notes                                |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| float  | 4 bytes | Must use `f` at the end (e.g., 5.6f) |
| double | 8 bytes | Default type for decimal numbers     |

### Notes

* `double` is preferred because it offers greater precision.
* `float` uses less memory but is less precise.

### Example

```java
float f = 5.8f;
double d = 5.6;   // By default, decimals are considered double
```


## 3. Character Type

Characters represent **single letters, digits, or symbols**.
Java uses **Unicode**, allowing it to support characters from all languages worldwide.

| Type | Size    | Example         |
| ---- | ------- | --------------- |
| char | 2 bytes | `char c = 'k';` |

### Notes

* Characters must be written in **single quotes** (`'a'`, `'9'`, `'$'`).
* Behind the scenes, characters are stored as numeric Unicode values.


## 4. Boolean Type

Booleans can store only two values:

* `true`
* `false`

### Notes

* Java booleans do **not** behave like numbers (`0` and `1`) as in C/C++.
* They are mainly used for conditions, decision-making, and loops.

### Example

```java
boolean b = true;
```


## Example Program

The following example shows all primitive types in action:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 9;
        byte by = 127;
        short sh = 558;
        long l = 5584L;

        float f = 5.8f;
        double d = 5.6;

        char c = 'k';
        boolean b = true;

        System.out.println("int: " + num1);
        System.out.println("byte: " + by);
        System.out.println("short: " + sh);
        System.out.println("long: " + l);
        System.out.println("float: " + f);
        System.out.println("double: " + d);
        System.out.println("char: " + c);
        System.out.println("boolean: " + b);
    }
}
```


## Key Point Recap

* Java is a **strongly typed** language → every variable must have a declared type.
* Use **L** for long values and **f** for float values.
* `char` uses **Unicode** to support global characters.
* `boolean` can only store `true` or `false`.
* Primitive types are stored **directly in memory**, making them fast and efficient.
