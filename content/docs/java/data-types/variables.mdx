## Why Do We Build Software?

Software exists to solve **real-world problems**, and every meaningful problem involves handling **data**.  
This data may represent numbers, text, user input, sensor readings, or results of calculations. To work with this information effectively, programs need a way to **store values temporarily in memory**, and this is done using **variables**.

<Callout type="info">
Variables allow Java programs to store, update, and reuse data while the program is running.
</Callout>

A variable is one of the most fundamental building blocks in programming. Mastering variables will help you write more powerful, flexible, and dynamic programs.


## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is like a **labeled container** in memory that stores a piece of data.  
When your program runs, the JVM allocates space in memory to hold the value.

Every variable has:

- A **name** (also called an identifier)  
- A **data type** (defines what kind of value it can store)  
- A **value** (the actual data stored)

### Example:

```java
int age = 25;    // 'age' is a variable of type int
```

Here:

* `int` → data type
* `age` → variable name
* `25` → value stored in the variable

You can change the value of a variable at any time as the program executes.


## Naming Conventions

Java has specific rules for naming variables, and following good style makes your code easy to read and maintain.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Start Rules">
    A variable name must start with a <b>letter</b>, <code>_</code>, or <code>$</code>.  
    It can contain numbers after the first character.  
    It cannot start with a digit like <code>1value</code>.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Meaningful Names">
    Choose descriptive names that represent the stored data, such as  
    <code>studentName</code>, <code>accountBalance</code>, <code>speedLimit</code>.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Camel Case Style">
    Java follows <b>camelCase</b> for variable names:  
    example → <code>firstName</code>, <code>maxSpeed</code>, <code>totalMarks</code>.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Avoid Special Symbols">
    Do not use illegal symbols like <code>@</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>-</code>.  
    Only letters, digits, <code>_</code>, and <code>$</code> are allowed.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Good naming improves readability and reduces bugs.


## Strongly Typed Language

Java is a **strongly typed language**, meaning every variable must have a **declared data type**.
This helps the compiler prevent mistakes and ensures safer code.

Common data types include:

* `int` → whole numbers
* `double` → decimals
* `String` → text
* `boolean` → true or false

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why Java Enforces Data Types?">
    Java checks variable types during compilation.  
    This prevents errors such as adding text to numbers or assigning an incompatible value.  
    Strong typing makes programs more predictable and reliable.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>


## Example Code 1 – Direct Computation

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(3 + 5);  
        System.out.println(8 + 7);  
    }
}
```

Here, values are used directly without storing them in variables.
While this works, it doesn’t scale well for larger programs.

### Print vs Println

* `print` → prints output on the **same line**
* `println` → prints and moves to the **next line**


## Example Code 2 – Using Variables

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 3;  
        System.out.println(num);   // Prints 3
    }
}
```

Here, we store a value in a variable and then print it.
This approach is more flexible because you can change the value of `num` anytime.


## Example Code 3 – Storing Results

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 3;
        int num2 = 5;
        int result = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println(result);   // Output: 8
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates:

* Using multiple variables
* Performing a calculation
* Storing the result in another variable

Variables allow you to break larger problems into smaller steps.


## Key Point Summary

* Variables are **containers** that store temporary data in memory.
* Each variable has a **name**, **type**, and **value**.
* Java uses **strong typing** to prevent type-related errors.
* Variables make programs reusable, readable, and more dynamic.
* Calculations and logic become easier and clearer when using variables.
