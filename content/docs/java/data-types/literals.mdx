Literals are one of the simplest yet most fundamental concepts in Java.  
Every program works with values, and literals represent those values written **directly in the code**.  
Understanding them is essential for correct variable assignment, readability, and writing clean Java programs.


## What is a Literal?

A **literal** is a fixed value assigned directly to a variable without computation.  
Whenever you type a number, character, or boolean value directly into your program, you are using a literal.

Example:

```java
int x = 10;   // 10 is a literal
```

Here, `10` is directly written into the code, so it is considered a literal.
Java supports several types of literals, each designed to represent different kinds of values.


## Types of Literals

Java provides different categories of literals depending on the kind of data being represented.


## 1. Integer Literals

Integer literals represent whole numbers and can be written in **multiple number systems**.
This flexibility helps in low-level programming, bit manipulation, and readability.

### Different Ways to Write Integer Literals

```java
int num1 = 0b101;        // Binary literal (prefix 0b) → 5
int num2 = 0x78;         // Hexadecimal literal (prefix 0x) → 120
int num3 = 1000_000_00;  // Underscore for readability → 100000000
```

### Notes

* The prefix `0b` or `0B` is used for binary.
* The prefix `0x` or `0X` is used for hexadecimal.
* Underscores (`_`) can be placed between digits to improve readability.
* Java does **not** allow numbers to start with zero for octal in modern versions.


## 2. Floating-Point Literals

Floating-point literals represent decimal numbers.
Java allows writing them using normal decimal notation or **scientific notation** (also called exponential notation).

### Examples

```java
double num4 = 12e10;  // 12 × 10^10 (scientific notation)
float f = 5.6f;       // Use 'f' or 'F' for float
double d = 5.6;       // Decimal is double by default
```

### Notes

* `double` is the default type for decimal numbers.
* A `float` requires the suffix `f` or `F`.
* Scientific notation uses `e` or `E` for powers of 10.

## 3. Character Literals

Character literals represent a **single character** enclosed in **single quotes**.

### Examples

```java
char c1 = 'a';         // Direct character
char c2 = 65;          // Unicode/ASCII value → 'A'
char c3 = '\u0041';    // Unicode literal → 'A'
```

### Notes

* Java uses Unicode, so characters from all languages can be represented.
* The escape sequence `\uXXXX` represents Unicode characters.

## 4. Boolean Literals

Boolean literals are used in conditional logic, loops, and decision-making.
They represent values of truth.

### Examples

```java
boolean b1 = true;
boolean b2 = false;
```

There are **only two** possible boolean literals in Java.


## Example Program

The following program demonstrates various literal types used together:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 0b101;         // Binary → 5
        int num2 = 0x78;          // Hexadecimal → 120
        int num3 = 1000_000_00;   // Readable large number
        double num4 = 12e10;      // Scientific notation
        char c = 'a';
        c = (char)(c + 1);        // 'b'

        boolean flag = true;

        System.out.println(num1);
        System.out.println(num2);
        System.out.println(num3);
        System.out.println(num4);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(flag);
    }
}
```


## Key Notes (Recap)

* Use **underscores (`_`)** to make large numbers easier to read.
* Prefixes:

  * `0b` → binary
  * `0x` → hexadecimal
* Floating-point literals can use **scientific notation** (`e` / `E`).
* Characters can be written using:

  * Single quotes → `'a'`
  * ASCII/Unicode values → `65`
  * Unicode escape sequences → `'\u0041'`
* Booleans only accept `true` or `false`.
