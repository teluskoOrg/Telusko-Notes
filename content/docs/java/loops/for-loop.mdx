## Why For Loop?

In a `while` loop, the **initialization**, **condition**, and **update** are written in different places.  
This sometimes makes the loop harder to read because the logic is spread out.

The **for loop** provides a more compact and organized structure by placing all three components in a **single line**.  
This makes it especially useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

A for loop is ideal for:

- counting loops  
- iterating fixed ranges  
- nested iterations  
- pattern printing  
- working with arrays and collections

## Syntax

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // statements
}
```

### Meaning of Each Part

* **initialization** → runs once before the loop starts
* **condition** → checked before every iteration
* **update** → runs after each loop iteration

If the condition becomes false, the loop stops.


## Example 1 – Simple For Loop

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hi " + i);
}
```

### Output

```
Hi 1
Hi 2
Hi 3
Hi 4
```

### Explanation

* Loop starts with `i = 1`
* Runs as long as `i <= 4`
* Prints each value of `i`
* `i++` increases the counter after every iteration

This is the most common use of a for loop—simple counting.


## Example 2 – Nested For Loop

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
    System.out.println("Day " + i);

    for (int j = 1; j < 9; j++) {
        System.out.println(" " + (j + 8));
    }
}
```

### Sample Output

```
Day 1
 9
 10
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
Day 2
 9
 10
 ...
```

### Explanation

* The **outer loop** runs 4 times — representing days.
* For each day, the **inner loop** prints numbers from `9` to `16`.
* This structure is extremely common when dealing with **rows and columns**, **grids**, **tables**, or **patterns**.

Nested loops allow repetitive tasks *inside* repetitive tasks.


## Special Usage of the For Loop

### 1. Infinite Loop

```java
for (;;) {
    System.out.println("Running forever...");
}
```

### Explanation

* All parts are empty.
* Condition defaults to **true**, so the loop never ends.
* Same as:

```java
while (true) { }
```

Infinite loops are often used in game loops, server listeners, etc.


### 2. For Loop as a While Loop

You can leave the initialization or update part empty:

```java
int i = 1;
for (; i <= 4;) {
    System.out.println("Hi " + i);
    i++;
}
```

### Explanation

* Initialization is done outside the loop.
* Update is done manually inside the loop.
* Behavior becomes identical to:

```java
while (i <= 4) { }
```

This shows how flexible a for loop can be.


### 3. Multiple Updates in One For Statement

```java
for (int i = 1, j = 5; i <= j; i++, j--) {
    System.out.println(i + " " + j);
}
```

### Explanation

* You can initialize multiple variables.
* And update multiple variables in each iteration.
* This is useful in algorithms where two indices move **towards each other**, such as:

  * checking palindrome strings
  * working with two-pointer techniques
  * merging data


## Key Notes

* `for` loop is best when the **number of iterations is known** in advance.
* It keeps initialization, condition, and update neatly together—making code more readable.
* The loop is flexible:

  * Can become an **infinite loop**
  * Can mimic a **while loop**
  * Can use **multiple counters**
* Common tool for patterns, counting tasks, arrays, and nested structures.
