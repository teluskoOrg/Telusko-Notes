## What Is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
To understand it clearly, think of any real-world object. A human, for example, has data such as name and age. In real life, you cannot directly set someone’s age to a negative number. There must be rules and restrictions.

In Java, **encapsulation helps us protect data** so that it cannot be modified directly from outside the class.

## Definition

Encapsulation means:

* **Binding data and methods** together into a single unit (class)
* **Restricting direct access** to internal data using access modifiers  
* Providing **controlled access** through methods

Encapsulation ensures data security, consistency, and better maintainability.


## Example Without Encapsulation

```java
class Human {
    int age;
    String name;
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Human obj = new Human();
        obj.age = 11;
        obj.name = "Navin";

        System.out.println(obj.age + " " + obj.name);
    }
}
```

In this example:

* Variables are public by default
* Any code can change them freely
* No validation or protection exists

This leads to weak data integrity.


## Applying Encapsulation

We can protect data by:

1. Marking variables as **private**
2. Creating **public getter and setter methods** to access them

```java
class Human {
    private int age;
    private String name;

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int a) {
        if (a > 0)
            age = a;
        else
            System.out.println("Invalid age");
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String n) {
        name = n;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Human obj = new Human();
        obj.setAge(22);
        obj.setName("Navin");

        System.out.println(obj.getName() + " is " + obj.getAge() + " years old");
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Navin is 22 years old
```

Now:

* Data is hidden inside the class
* Access is controlled through setter and getter methods
* Validation can be performed before assigning values


## Why Encapsulation?

Encapsulation offers several advantages:

### 1. Data Hiding

Prevent accidental or unauthorized modification of internal data.

### 2. Validation

Setter methods allow you to check values before assigning them.

### 3. Maintainability

Internal implementation can change without affecting external code.

### 4. Flexibility

You can control how other parts of the program interact with the object.

## Summary

* Encapsulation binds **data** and **methods** into a single class.
* Data is kept private and accessed via public methods.
* This ensures safety, validation, and structured programming.
* In Java, encapsulation = **private variables + getters/setters**.
