## Where to Create a Class

In Java, you can write **multiple classes inside the same file**.  
However, only **one class** can be declared as `public`, and the **file name must match that public class name**.

For example:

File name → `Demo.java`  
Public class inside → `public class Demo { ... }`

This rule helps Java identify the main entry point and organize code in a structured way.


## Example – Creating and Using a Class

```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int num1, int num2) {
        System.out.println("In add");
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator obj = new Calculator(); // object creation
        int result = obj.add(5, 4);        // calling method using object
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
````

This program defines a `Calculator` class and uses it inside the `Demo` class to perform an addition.


## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Defining a Class

```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int num1, int num2) {
        System.out.println("In add");
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

A class:

* Contains **properties** (variables) and **behaviours** (methods)
* Acts as a **blueprint** for creating objects

Here:

* The class name is `Calculator`
* It contains one method `add()`, which returns the sum of two integers
* `public` before the method means it can be called from other classes


### 2. Creating the Main Class

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator obj = new Calculator();
        int result = obj.add(5, 4);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

`Demo` contains the `main()` method, which is the **starting point** of every Java program.

Inside `main()`:

1. An object of `Calculator` is created
2. The `add()` method is called using that object
3. The result is printed

## Important Concepts

### Object Creation

```java
Calculator obj = new Calculator();
```

This line performs three roles:

1. `Calculator` → the **type** of the object (class name)
2. `obj` → reference variable (stores address of the object)
3. `new Calculator()` → creates the actual object in memory

Think of it like this:

* The object (`new Calculator()`) is the actual device
* The reference (`obj`) is the remote control used to operate the device

Without the reference, you cannot call methods of the object.

### Method Call Using Object

```java
int result = obj.add(5, 4);
```

* The object `obj` calls the method `add()`
* The values `5` and `4` are passed as arguments
* The method returns the sum, which is stored in `result`


## Output

```
In add
9
```

The line *"In add"* prints from inside the method, and `9` is the final result of the addition.


## Summary

* A **class** defines what an object will contain (properties) and what it can do (methods).
* An **object** is created using the `new` keyword.
* The **reference variable** (like `obj`) is used to access methods and variables of the object.
* Only **one public class** is allowed per `.java` file, and the filename must match that class name.
* Methods inside the class are invoked using the object created from that class.
