## Understanding the Real World

Everything around us can be seen as an **object**—a car, a mobile phone, a book, or even a person.  
Every object has two important characteristics:

1. **What it knows** → its **properties** (also called attributes or fields)  
2. **What it does** → its **behaviour** (also called actions or methods)

This same idea is used in Java to design software using **objects**.


## Real-Life Example

Consider a **Human** as an object:

- **Properties:** name, age, height, weight  
- **Behaviours:** walking, eating, sleeping, talking  

In Java, an object works the same way—data (properties) + actions (methods).


## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is an **Object-Oriented Programming** language.  
OOP helps us represent real-world entities in code using **classes** and **objects**.

Key idea behind OOP:

> Real-world problems are solved by modeling real-world objects in the program.

Objects interact with each other to perform tasks, just like real entities in life.


## What is a Class?

A **class** is a **blueprint**, **design**, or **template** for creating objects.

A class defines:

- What an object **contains** (properties)
- What an object **can do** (methods)

Think of a class as an **architect’s plan of a house**.  
The plan is not a house, but you can create many houses using that plan.  
Similarly, from one class, you can create many objects.

### Example

```java
class Human {
    // Properties
    String name;
    int age;

    // Behaviours
    void walk() {
        System.out.println(name + " is walking.");
    }

    void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}
```

Here, `Human` is the blueprint; it describes what every human object will have and do.


## What is an Object?

An **object** is a **real instance** created from a class.
It occupies memory and contains actual values for its properties.

### Example

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Human h1 = new Human();   // Creating object
        h1.name = "Navin";        // Assigning values
        h1.age = 30;

        h1.walk();
        h1.eat();
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Navin is walking.
Navin is eating.
```

Here, `h1` is an object created from the class `Human`.
It has real values for `name` and `age`, and it performs actions defined in the class.


## In Short

| Concept | Meaning                         | Real-World Comparison            |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Class   | A design or blueprint           | Architect’s plan of a house      |
| Object  | Instance created from the class | Actual house built from the plan |


## Summary

* Java uses **objects** to model real-world entities.
* Objects have **properties** (data) and **behaviours** (methods).
* A **class** defines what an object will contain and how it will behave.
* A class itself is not an object; it is only a **blueprint**.
* Objects are the actual entities that exist in memory and interact with each other during program execution.
